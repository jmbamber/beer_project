      "500ml bottle Pours a little over a finger of white head into my can-style glass. Body is crystal clear, and the lightest shade of yellow in color. Large amount of bubbles coming up. Overall looks good so far. Haven't had too many helles's recently (I bought this assuming it was a straight up German lager, but upon smelling it, I knew it had to be something else). Nose is noticeably sweeter than other euro lagers, less grassy hops as well, and less hops in general. Slight bready note, which is quite nice, and seems unusual for such a light malt bill. Once looking for it, DMS is present, which is apparently acceptable. Very sweet overall, but not gross, at least not yet. It smells quite nice, and to style, minus the welcome bready notes. Flavor is good. First thing that pops out is a relatively noticeable mineral feel. Breadyness, sweet malt, and a little DMS are all intertwined. The mineral feel is probably a nod to very good attenuation, because while it tastes a little sweet, it is dry as well. The slightest touch of hops hit towards the beginning/middle of the palate. I feel like I usually notice hops towards the end in euro lagers. It's a very nice flavor, maybe a touch light for me, but that's the style I suppose. Not to beat a dead horse, but the bready malt does help add a good amount of character here. Mouthfeel is nice. The carbonation is quite high. Body is very light. Feel is very balanced, sweet in some areas, but probably more dry overall. Drinkability is obviously very high. Nothing wrong at all, light, tasty. Head retention was pretty good for a lager. Didn't hang around extremely long, but the film was nice, and lingered a while. Lacing turned out very nice, pretty thick from top to bottom. Very good looking lager. Overall this is a very good beer. Not exactly my favorite style, but while it is veeeery light it does have some unique flavors other lighter lagers don't.\n",

The mineral feel is probably a nod to very good attenuation, because while it tastes a little sweet, it is dry as well. The slightest touch of hops hit towards the beginning/middle of the palate. I feel like I usually notice hops towards the end in euro lagers. It's a very nice flavor, maybe a touch light for me, but that's the style I suppose. Not to beat a dead horse, but the bready malt does help add a good amount of character here. Mouthfeel is nice. The carbonation is quite high. Body is very light. Feel is very balanced, sweet in some areas, but probably more dry overall. Drinkability is obviously very high. Nothing wrong at all, light, tasty. Head retention was pretty good for a lager. Didn't hang around extremely long, but the film was nice, and lingered a while. Lacing turned out very nice, pretty thick from top to bottom. Very good looking lager. Overall this is a very good beer. Not exactly my favorite style, but while it is veeeery light it does have some unique flavors other lighter lagers don't.\n",

The mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied, adequately carbonated and dry in the finish. Overall, good. Green bottles and difficult to decipher date codes kept me from Hofbrau beers for years.

S: Fresh baked bread with a biscuity sweetness. Traces of grassy hops that imply a deeper herbal/vegetal quality. T: Comes on with a bready, sweetish malt character accented by faintly bitter grassiness. Mid palate articulates the sweetness with a more well-defined grassy hop flavor that carries through to the finish. Finishes with a bright almost-citrus note that lingers pleasantly. M: Crisp, not too light with fairly high carb. Refreshing, and substantial without feeling heavy. O: Hits all the marks for a Helles - big-but-crisp, thirst-quenching and full of flavor.

Honey on top of toasted crackers and bread in the flavor. Presents malty and not bitter.  Feel: Perfect body as this one is medium bodied and well-carbonated. Tons of grassy Noble hop flavor, but the malty sweetness drives through a smooth finish that is just the right amount to want you to take another sip. Overall: This is one of the best helles I've had.

      "Served on tap in a pint glass Appearance- The beer pours a clear golden amber color with a one finger head of white foam. The head fades rather fast to leave a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell- The aroma of the brew is biggest of caramel and some cereal malts. Along with these smells are some light toasted aromas and a bit of earth and grass hop and a hint of citrus. Taste – The taste begins with a slightly grainy, light caramel, and bready taste that has hints of some earthiness upfront. As the flavor profile advances some light lemon and citrus as well as more caramel tastes come to the tongue. In the end one is left with a rather grainy bread taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is just above average in thickness and normal in carbonation. For the flavor profile being more malt based and somewhat grainy the feel is fantastic overall and makes for an easy drinking brew. Overall – This is a nice easy drinking bready brew. A good summer to winter transition brew.\n",

Taste – The taste begins with a slightly grainy, light caramel, and bready taste that has hints of some earthiness upfront. As the flavor profile advances some light lemon and citrus as well as more caramel tastes come to the tongue. In the end one is left with a rather grainy bread taste to linger on the tongue.

Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aroma of big cracker, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, light honey/nuttiness, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity of bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big cracker, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, light honey/nuttiness/pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, light honey/nuttiness/pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with zero yeast notes present. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, bready/grainy, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5%. Overall this is an excellent Munich helles! All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth and refreshing to drink with the mellowly bitter/drying finish.

The feel is slightly creamy, a nice carbonation tingle with each swallow, maybe simple, but so good.

Pours slightly hazy deep golden/amber color with a 1 finger dense and rocky off white head with awesome retention, that reduces to a small cap that lasts. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aroma of big cracker, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, light honey/nuttiness, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity of bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big cracker, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, light honey/nuttiness/pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, light honey/nuttiness/pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with zero yeast notes present. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, bready/grainy, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5%. Overall this is an excellent Munich helles! All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth and refreshing to drink with the mellowly bitter/drying finish. Nicely rich clean Pils malt showcase, with solid noble hop presence/balance. A very enjoyable offering, and perfect style example.\n",

      "Served on tap in a pint glass Appearance – The beer is served a pale golden amber color with a one finger head of white foam. The head has a decent level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a good sum of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma of the brew is quite grainy in nature with a little bit of a bready and doughy aroma mixed within. Along with these smells comes a little bit of a harvest fruit smell and a touch of grass and hay. Taste – The taste begins with a rather crisp and clean doughy malt taste that has a moderate level of graininess as well as a touch of fruit sweetness of apple and pear. As the taste advances some other light sweet tastes of caramel develop all while the grain increases a touch and is joined by some light grass and a bit of hay. These tastes take the taste to the end, and leave on with a rather clean, but slightly more doughy taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is average to slightly thicker for a lager of 4.9 % with a carbonation level that is rather average. For the style a little thinner of a body may have been slightly better, but overall the feel was pretty decent and does make for a good sipper. Overall – A very nice lager overall. The flavor profile is rich, but not overpowering with a nice easy drinking feel and style.\n",

      "A very good example of the Munich Helles style. A billowy white head stays almost to the very end of the beer (mine was poured in a litre dimpled glass like you'd get in a Munich beer garden). A very nice aroma, like that of freshly baked bread, with a hint of citrus from the hops. Good mouthfeel, nicely carbonated. The taste is malt forward as it should be for the style, some hop bitterness coming in at the very end. My only gripe, and perhaps it is being somewhat nit-pickey, is that at times, I have had fresh bottles of this beer that seemed almost too void of malt flavor to where the hop character seemed overly aggresive. The beer seemed more in the German Pils style than a helles, but again, it hasn't happened often. Overall, a beer worthy of its fine reputation among Munich helles fans!\n",

Pours fairly crystal clear medium golden yellow color with a 1 finger dense and rocky off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice thick spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of cracker, white bread dough, biscuit, and light honey/toast, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. A bit of fruity/yeasty aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice aromas with good balance of bready malt and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of cracker, white bread dough, biscuit, and light honey/toast, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, woody, floral, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread dough, biscuit, and light honey/toast, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great robustness and balance of bready malt and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no lingering hop astringency after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Very clean on lager flavors, minimal fruity/yeasty notes. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth and moderately bready/grainy/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.9%. Overall this is a delicious Munich helles style. All around nice robustness and balance of bready malt and earthy hop flavors; very smooth, refreshing, and fairly crisp/clean to drink with the moderately bitter/drying finish. Very flavorful and not watery for the ABV. Perfectly balanced between clean/nicely rich pils/munich malts and earthy noble hops. Mild residual sweetness with lingering crisp dryness.

Pours fairly crystal clear medium golden yellow color with a 1 finger dense and rocky off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice thick spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of cracker, white bread dough, biscuit, and light honey/toast, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. A bit of fruity/yeasty aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice aromas with good balance of bready malt and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of cracker, white bread dough, biscuit, and light honey/toast, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, woody, floral, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread dough, biscuit, and light honey/toast, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great robustness and balance of bready malt and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no lingering hop astringency after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Very clean on lager flavors, minimal fruity/yeasty notes. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth and moderately bready/grainy/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.9%. Overall this is a delicious Munich helles style. All around nice robustness and balance of bready malt and earthy hop flavors; very smooth, refreshing, and fairly crisp/clean to drink with the moderately bitter/drying finish. Very flavorful and not watery for the ABV. Perfectly balanced between clean/nicely rich pils/munich malts and earthy noble hops. Mild residual sweetness with lingering crisp dryness. A very enjoyable offering, and spot on style example as expected.\n",

      "Served on tap in a pint glass Appearance – The beer is served a pale golden amber color with a one finger head of white foam. The head has a decent level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a good sum of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma of the brew is quite grainy in nature with a little bit of a bready and doughy aroma mixed within. Along with these smells comes a little bit of a harvest fruit smell and a touch of grass and hay. Taste – The taste begins with a rather crisp and clean doughy malt taste that has a moderate level of graininess as well as a touch of fruit sweetness of apple and pear. As the taste advances some other light sweet tastes of caramel develop all while the grain increases a touch and is joined by some light grass and a bit of hay. These tastes take the taste to the end, and leave on with a rather clean, but slightly more doughy taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is average to slightly thicker for a lager of 4.9 % with a carbonation level that is rather average. For the style a little thinner of a body may have been slightly better, but overall the feel was pretty decent and does make for a good sipper. Overall – A very nice lager overall. The flavor profile is rich, but not overpowering with a nice easy drinking feel and style.\n",

      "A very good example of the Munich Helles style. A billowy white head stays almost to the very end of the beer (mine was poured in a litre dimpled glass like you'd get in a Munich beer garden). A very nice aroma, like that of freshly baked bread, with a hint of citrus from the hops. Good mouthfeel, nicely carbonated. The taste is malt forward as it should be for the style, some hop bitterness coming in at the very end. My only gripe, and perhaps it is being somewhat nit-pickey, is that at times, I have had fresh bottles of this beer that seemed almost too void of malt flavor to where the hop character seemed overly aggresive. The beer seemed more in the German Pils style than a helles, but again, it hasn't happened often. Overall, a beer worthy of its fine reputation among Munich helles fans!\n",

Il retrogusto presenta un discreto equilibrio tra l'amaro ed il dolce del malto. Si tratta di una birra mediamente carbonata e frizzante, comunque beverina.

Aroma: Very grassy noble hops. A little lemon. Pale biscuit malt aromas. Flavor: Taste follows the nose. Delicious grassy, lemon hops. A good yeast presence. Finishes with a grainy biscuit &amp; bread malt that is balanced by a peppery yeast to finish completely dry. Feel: Light to medium bodied with good carbonation. Crisp and clean. Overall: A delicious and smooth drinking helles lager. Nails the grassy and lemon noble hops with the pale malts perfectly. Nice yeast balance to finish dry. So crisp and clean on the palate.

The aftertaste shows a decent balance between the bitter and and the sweet malt. It is a medium carbonated and sparkling beer, ultimately drinkable.\n",

      "Appearance: Pours a completely clear color with a tint of lemon yellow. Incredibly light and clear. More so than a typical lager. Has a medium-heavy head that lingers, but is crisp. Aroma: Very grassy noble hops. A little lemon. Pale biscuit malt aromas. Flavor: Taste follows the nose. Delicious grassy, lemon hops. A good yeast presence. Finishes with a grainy biscuit &amp; bread malt that is balanced by a peppery yeast to finish completely dry. Feel: Light to medium bodied with good carbonation. Crisp and clean. Overall: A delicious and smooth drinking helles lager. Nails the grassy and lemon noble hops with the pale malts perfectly. Nice yeast balance to finish dry. So crisp and clean on the palate. One of the most refreshing beers and lagers I've had. This beer could be a staple of the style. This one is worth coming back to.\n",

Flavors are smooth and well balanced with notes of light caramel, bready grain, honey, and nut along with the modest noble hops adding spice, earth, and grassy flavors. Medium body, ample carbonation, balanced dry finish. Classic example of the style. I can see myself buying this in the can fotmat again.\n",

      "330 ml bottle into lager glass, best before 7/2019. Pours fairly crystal clear medium golden yellow color with a 1 finger dense and rocky off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice thick spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of cracker, white bread dough, biscuit, and light honey/toast, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. A bit of fruity/yeasty aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice aromas with good balance of bready malt and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of cracker, white bread dough, biscuit, and light honey/toast, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, woody, floral, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread dough, biscuit, and light honey/toast, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great robustness and balance of bready malt and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no lingering hop astringency after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Very clean on lager flavors, minimal fruity/yeasty notes. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth and moderately bready/grainy/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.9%. Overall this is a delicious Munich helles style. All around nice robustness and balance of bready malt and earthy hop flavors; very smooth, refreshing, and fairly crisp/clean to drink with the moderately bitter/drying finish. Very flavorful and not watery for the ABV. Perfectly balanced between clean/nicely rich pils/munich malts and earthy noble hops. Mild residual sweetness with lingering crisp dryness. A very enjoyable offering, and spot on style example as expected.\n",

      "500mL canned 1/22/19 BB 1/22/20 poured into a pint glass at fridge temp 4.9% ABV. The beer pours brilliantly bright light golden yellow with nearly white head. The head recedes to a thin cap leaving a few spots of lacing. The aroma is equal parts bready and yeasty. Very pleasant. The taste is bready malt with lemon zest trailing off to a low to medium bitter floral and grassy finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with just above average carbonation and a dry finish. There are no glaring flaws or off flavors from brewing or fermentation. Overall, very good. This is an exceptional product in the correct packaging at a fair price.\n",

S: Has that classic bready malt smell. Not much else. T: Crisp with a crackery malt taste, just a little bitterness with some earthy hops. Perhaps a little sweet with some generic fruit undertones. Finishes crisp with a bready taste at the finish. F: Light with good carbonation, perhaps a bit too much. Refreshing! O: To me, this is what an everyday German helles style lager should be. It does not amaze me, and is perhaps a bit simple, but it is a damn good thirst-quenching beer.\n",

Funny because you feel the traces of the original Czecz pilsner and you can kinda follow through the history/evolution of the Lager.

Pours slightly hazy pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of cracker, white bread dough, biscuit, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with pale malt and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. A bit fruity/yeasty, but not overwhelming. Taste of cracker, white bread dough, biscuit, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Light herbal/grassy/spicy hop bitterness on the finish. An odd touch of metal that went away through the glass. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread dough, biscuit, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good robustness of pale malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Nicely clean on lager flavors, minimal fruity/yeasty notes. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is good. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5.2%. Overall this is a good Helles. All around good robustness of pale malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink with the mildly bitter/drying finish. Very flavorful and not watery for the ABV, but a little weird on mouthfeel. Nothing but clean pils malts and solid noble hop balance. A nicely enjoyable offering, and great style example.\n",

Pours slightly hazy pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of cracker, white bread dough, biscuit, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with pale malt and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. A bit fruity/yeasty, but not overwhelming. Taste of cracker, white bread dough, biscuit, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Light herbal/grassy/spicy hop bitterness on the finish. An odd touch of metal that went away through the glass. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread dough, biscuit, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good robustness of pale malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Nicely clean on lager flavors, minimal fruity/yeasty notes. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is good. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5.2%. Overall this is a good Helles. All around good robustness of pale malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink with the mildly bitter/drying finish. Very flavorful and not watery for the ABV, but a little weird on mouthfeel. Nothing but clean pils malts and solid noble hop balance. A nicely enjoyable offering, and great style example.\n",

      "Uggh, Just noticed the canned date is 11/7 and drinking on 4/7 (5 months old). Look is somewhat lackluster. No head at all. I do like the smell though. Lots of nice bready and grassy aromas in there. Taste is nice as well. Sweet and bready with the Euro malts/hop flavors I like. Nice body. Overall, I really wish I could get this one again a little fresher. Even 5 months old its still a solid German lager. Will try to revisit again with a fresher one and adjust my ratings.\n",

Taste is bready malt with with a hint of wheat, honey, aggressive lemon &amp; grass notes finishing with a pleasant Noble hops bitterness. Very clean, crisp &amp; drinkable.\n",

      "Gold in color with exceptional clarity. A faint wisp of off white is barely present on top. Faint odor of light bready malt is present. I taste light sourdough notes and just a hint of bittering hops in the fade. The body is very light, clean, and refreshing.\n",

      "Appearance: Pale golden-yellow body, minimally hazed, with a thin, wispy, white head. Smell: Pils malt, quickly toasted breadiness, cereal-hinted honeyish accent, a thin whiff of sulphur and a bit of herby hops. Taste: Semi-sweet pilsner maltiness with a bit of deeper breadiness. Slight honeyish vibe. Lightly fruity. Soft herbal quality to the hops, subtly bitter. Remains slightly sweetish on the close. Mouthfeel: Medium-light body. Medium carbonation. Overall: Nicely refreshing option.\n",

      "Back to the Schlenkerla: it’s a film idea I had about a mad scientist who invents a barley kiln that can travel back in time… or not. Brauerei Heller-Trum Aecht Schlenkerla Helles Lagerbier is pretty much the last Schlenkerla I have to review, which makes me sad because I really will miss the feeling of opening a new Schlenkerla, the child-like surprise at the smoky goodness within. Oh well, this Bavarian Helles Lager is their brew that “doesn’t have smoked malt but tastes smoky anyway because nothing within a kilometre of the Schlenkerla brauhaus can shake away the smoke”. Haven’t reviewed a proper Helles in a while either, I’m looking forward to this with bacon breath… or bated breath, one of those 2 things. Poured from a 500ml bottle into a stein. A: Clear golden-straw body with a massive 1 inch white head that slowly dies back leaving plenty of sticky lace inside the glass. This looks, and forgive my Aussie tongue here; you beaut mate! 9/10. S: That irrepressible Schlenkerla beechwood smoke comes through with less gusto than usual, yet it’s still quite smoky for this (their un-smoked) brew. Light notes of bread, honey, and a herbal touch come through as well – all classic Munich Helles characters. Still cannot escape how smoky this beer is. 8/10. T: This is Schlenkerla’s light beer for those of us who are unaccustomed to the Rauchbier (Smoke Beer) world. Flavour profile is all Munich/all Helles with notes of: bread yeast, hints of honey, light cut grass, smoked ham (of course) and a long dry finish that is punctuated by herbal note at the finish. Very flavoursome for a 4.3% ABV brew, this gets my award for “the almost mid-strength beer that actually has flavour”… I’m working on a better title [till then: deal]. Aftertaste has a lingering bitterness that the smoke accentuates, this is a nuanced brew indeed. 8/10. M: Surprisingly full-bodied too for a 4.3% brew, oh my Schlenkerla you are full of surprises. Medium bodied with a light but dense carbonation, sehr gut! 9/10. D: I mean this is another great beer from Schlenkerla, the only hard thing to swallow (in comparison to their Fastenbier and more-so their Urbock) is the price: exactly the same as Fastenbier and Urbock at my local. Really if I’m spending $10 on a Rauchbier it’s got to be the Urbock. This however is a nice example of a brewery diversifying their range without alienating the punters, a tasty Lager incursion from those smoky chaps at Schlenkerla, prost! 8/10.

      "Bottled on 6/20/19. 12oz bottle poured into a tulip. Pours golden with nice transparency and has bubbles racing upwards; fluffy white head that falls leaving very nice retention and sticky lacing. The aromas are nice and basically what you would expect from a pilsener/lager. Some floral notes along with some mild hints of citrus. Some fresh bread. Some fresh grass. Grains and malts are there. The flavors follow the nose perfectly. Everything is very clean, crisp, sharp and refreshing. Moderate bitterness. Malts do their thing, but almost take a backseat. Finishes dry. Alcohol goes unnoticed. Mouthfeel is very nice. It's light-bodied with active carbonation. It's sharp, crisp, smooth and easy to drink.  This is a great brew. It's not flashy, but the \"simplicity\" and craftsmanship is what takes this one over the top. It's a traditional example of the style and doesn't try to be something else. It basically has everything that you would want from a pilsener/lager. This is really enjoyable stuff.\n",

We figured spending our time catching up and talking was more worthwhile than watching two NFL games that were not incredibly fun to watch. This beer pours a cloudy golden hue with a slight amber tint to it with light carbonation easily visible. The head is white and frothy, dissipating a thin lacing that is retained for quite some time. 3.75/5 The aroma is chiefly of buttered white bread with an earthy/light spiciness that acts alongside a note of cracker and biscuit. The aroma is quite malty but not really sweet, rather steering towards grainy. 3.5/5 The flavor is grainy and bready in the beginning before a bit of butter and cracker comes through. There seems to be a good amount of pilsner malt that leads into grassy hops with the focus being chiefly on the hops here. Moderate bitterness comes through quite early and lingers for quite some time after swallowing. 3.5/5 The mouthfeel features a light carbonation burn up front with a light to medium body that leads into a moderate dryness that lingers for a very good while upon swallowing. 3.5/5 This beer just comes across as odd for the style with a too heavy emphasis being placed on the bitterness and grassy hops. Very unbalanced with the sweetness and graininess of the malt not really coming through. I do like this beer, but I would reach for several other Helles before this one. 3.5/5\n",

      "Some friends of my wife and myself were over just a few nights ago and decided to pick this bottle up from a local bottle shop since the NFL games were not going our way. We figured spending our time catching up and talking was more worthwhile than watching two NFL games that were not incredibly fun to watch. This beer pours a cloudy golden hue with a slight amber tint to it with light carbonation easily visible. The head is white and frothy, dissipating a thin lacing that is retained for quite some time. 3.75/5 The aroma is chiefly of buttered white bread with an earthy/light spiciness that acts alongside a note of cracker and biscuit. The aroma is quite malty but not really sweet, rather steering towards grainy. 3.5/5 The flavor is grainy and bready in the beginning before a bit of butter and cracker comes through. There seems to be a good amount of pilsner malt that leads into grassy hops with the focus being chiefly on the hops here. Moderate bitterness comes through quite early and lingers for quite some time after swallowing. 3.5/5 The mouthfeel features a light carbonation burn up front with a light to medium body that leads into a moderate dryness that lingers for a very good while upon swallowing. 3.5/5 This beer just comes across as odd for the style with a too heavy emphasis being placed on the bitterness and grassy hops. Very unbalanced with the sweetness and graininess of the malt not really coming through. I do like this beer, but I would reach for several other Helles before this one. 3.5/5\n",

      "Bottled on 6/20/19. 12oz bottle poured into a tulip. Pours golden with nice transparency and has bubbles racing upwards; fluffy white head that falls leaving very nice retention and sticky lacing. The aromas are nice and basically what you would expect from a pilsener/lager. Some floral notes along with some mild hints of citrus. Some fresh bread. Some fresh grass. Grains and malts are there. The flavors follow the nose perfectly. Everything is very clean, crisp, sharp and refreshing. Moderate bitterness. Malts do their thing, but almost take a backseat. Finishes dry. Alcohol goes unnoticed. Mouthfeel is very nice. It's light-bodied with active carbonation. It's sharp, crisp, smooth and easy to drink.  This is a great brew. It's not flashy, but the \"simplicity\" and craftsmanship is what takes this one over the top. It's a traditional example of the style and doesn't try to be something else. It basically has everything that you would want from a pilsener/lager. This is really enjoyable stuff.\n",

Lacing in rings as I drink down the glass. S: wow! Really smells the part! This smells exactly like Weihenstephaner original. Sweet malt, kiss of honey, noble hop grassiness, and just a taste of sulfur. Excellent! T: follows the smell. Sweet, bready malt, drizzle of honey, fine noble hops. M: where the helles style stands out, and 3F showing off at this point. Creamy, rich, mouth filling malty texture but with lager crispness and attenuation. O: some brewers get by on a gimmick. 3 Floyds could do that, given the hype that surrounds them. But this is a testament to pure brewing skill. This is a difficult style, and they have NAILED it. The craft brew newbies will talk trash because this is a lightly hopped lager. But this beer is nothing short of a work of art. It is a study in finesse and balance. Perfectly executed.

Nose of corn syrup, honey, caramel and flowers, challah bread and a light peppery quality, the apple, peach fruit scents are faint and for the most part not especially missed. Medium-bodied, light on the palate with a gentle fluffiness. More of that corn, dough and sweet grains with soft orange like citrus tones, flowers and chamomile.

Lightly drying from bitterness as well. Very clean on lager flavors, with minimal yeast notes present. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready/grainy, and lightly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5.2%. Overall this is a delicious Helles. All around nice robustness and balance of pale malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, clean, and refreshing to drink. Very flavorful for the ABV. Nice clean pils malt showcase, with just enough earthy hops to balance. A very enjoyable offering, and spot on style example.\n",

      "Bottle dated L032021919. Pilsner glass. A: pours a bright yellow straw color with two fingers of white frothy head that lasts as a lengthy white cap. Streams of carbonation blasting away. S: familiar Munich malt that I love! Sulfury and floral. This aroma is about as classic German lager as it gets!  T: arrives with a crisp but bready malt sweetness, just a touch of honey. Mild floral hoppiness an mid palate leads to more bready sweetness on the swallow, followed by a mild bitterness. Perhaps just a touch too sweet for my taste.  M: thick and mouth-filling, but with a moderately crisp finish and high carbonation keeps it refreshing. O: really excellent, perfectly-executed Dortmunder style lager. Hoppier than Weihenstephaner Original, maltier than any pils I’ve had, it’s right in the middle. Unfortunately it is just a little sweeter and heavier than my preference; perhaps even sweeter than a helles. Would definitely buy again, but falls ever so slightly short of my expectations.\n",

      "Poured from the bottle into a Libbey style pilsner glass. Beaming crystal clear body, with minimal carbonation, some large some very minuscule. Rich lathery rocky bright white head, making easy three fingers of foam, with little retention but a small settling puck. Real nice looking lager. Big aroma of clean chewy grains, with light touches of herbal hops. Comes off like a giant classic loaf of fresh bread. Hits with a wallop and almost feels like you could bite into it. Faint hints of layered white cake as well. Real impressive palate. Large chewy mouthfeel full of excellent bready aromas and flavors. Thick rich malt and dough quality mixing with a smattering of herbal bite that just pops in the mouth. Clean but full and rich filling on the finish, touches just a hair of sweetness but almost toying with your senses. Spreadable touches of bakery bread and green herbs all over.

The white grape sweetness is very present over an enticing french bread (minus the crust) malt base. The noble spicing is perfect with honey and floral notes.

      "Updated on 4/11/18 - found a much fresher bottle to re-review. Appearance is unchanged. Aroma has much more noticeable toasted bread coming through on the nose, not as much grain on the nose. Delicate spicy hop notes gently caress the nose. The taste is where this fresh bottle really shines. Nice slightly sweet bready malt backbone. Feel is largely unchanged. Overall this bottle is much fresher and perhaps most surprisingly the biggest change isn't the hops but the lovely malt backbone to this beer.  (Reviewed blind - 4/16/18) Pours light straw color. Completely crystal clear with medium effervescence. Pillow-y white head dissipates leaving a ring of white foam along the outside of the beer with some partial spots of foam on top of the beer. 4.25 Aroma has notes of grain, bread, lightly toasted. Maybe a whiff of noble hops, but quite subtle. 4 Taste is predominately grainy – but does have some notes of white bread malts. Bit of sweetness comes through in the flavor – kind of fruity. More pronounced bitterness on the finish – floral. 3.5 Medium bodied. Vibrant carbonation. Semi-dry finish. 4.25\n",

      "I don't know what everyone else is looking at, but it doesn't get much more proper looking than this for the style. Perfectly clear light yellow, Billowing foamy white head, excellent retention and lacing. The aroma is dominated by freshly crushed grain and yeasty doughy bread, followed by grassy and flowery hops. Again, pretty solid. Flavor follows but a bit more grassy than I was anticipating. Feel is light and crisp and pretty well balanced, but finishes a bit dry and \"dirty\" feeling. Overall, I think this is a pretty darn good Helles. I wouldn't pay the price tag often for it as there are other great beers of this style readily available, but I definitely wouldn't turn one down.

      "Updated on 4/11/18 - found a much fresher bottle to re-review. Appearance is unchanged. Aroma has much more noticeable toasted bread coming through on the nose, not as much grain on the nose. Delicate spicy hop notes gently caress the nose. The taste is where this fresh bottle really shines. Nice slightly sweet bready malt backbone. Feel is largely unchanged. Overall this bottle is much fresher and perhaps most surprisingly the biggest change isn't the hops but the lovely malt backbone to this beer.  (Reviewed blind - 4/16/18) Pours light straw color. Completely crystal clear with medium effervescence. Pillow-y white head dissipates leaving a ring of white foam along the outside of the beer with some partial spots of foam on top of the beer. 4.25 Aroma has notes of grain, bread, lightly toasted. Maybe a whiff of noble hops, but quite subtle. 4 Taste is predominately grainy – but does have some notes of white bread malts. Bit of sweetness comes through in the flavor – kind of fruity. More pronounced bitterness on the finish – floral. 3.5 Medium bodied. Vibrant carbonation. Semi-dry finish. 4.25\n",

      "I don't know what everyone else is looking at, but it doesn't get much more proper looking than this for the style. Perfectly clear light yellow, Billowing foamy white head, excellent retention and lacing. The aroma is dominated by freshly crushed grain and yeasty doughy bread, followed by grassy and flowery hops. Again, pretty solid. Flavor follows but a bit more grassy than I was anticipating. Feel is light and crisp and pretty well balanced, but finishes a bit dry and \"dirty\" feeling. Overall, I think this is a pretty darn good Helles. I wouldn't pay the price tag often for it as there are other great beers of this style readily available, but I definitely wouldn't turn one down.

The pour is a clear looking yellow color with a quick lasting white head that dissolves to nothing. Bubbly. The aroma emits a traditional German bread and biscuit maltiness, crackers, and grass. The body is light or a bit better. But smooth for sure. Same sweet white bread and toasty sweetness in the taste with a twist of citrus and a mildly dry and clean, crisp finish. Highly quaffable.\n",

S: familiar Munich malt that I love! Sulfury and floral. This aroma is about as classic German lager as it gets!  T: arrives with a crisp but bready malt sweetness, just a touch of honey. Mild floral hoppiness an mid palate leads to more bready sweetness on the swallow, followed by a mild bitterness. Perhaps just a touch too sweet for my taste.  M: thick and mouth-filling, but with a moderately crisp finish and high carbonation keeps it refreshing. O: really excellent, perfectly-executed Dortmunder style lager. Hoppier than Weihenstephaner Original, maltier than any pils I’ve had, it’s right in the middle. Unfortunately it is just a little sweeter and heavier than my preference; perhaps even sweeter than a helles. Would definitely buy again, but falls ever so slightly short of my expectations.\n",

      "Poured from the bottle into a Libbey style pilsner glass. Beaming crystal clear body, with minimal carbonation, some large some very minuscule. Rich lathery rocky bright white head, making easy three fingers of foam, with little retention but a small settling puck. Real nice looking lager. Big aroma of clean chewy grains, with light touches of herbal hops. Comes off like a giant classic loaf of fresh bread. Hits with a wallop and almost feels like you could bite into it. Faint hints of layered white cake as well. Real impressive palate. Large chewy mouthfeel full of excellent bready aromas and flavors. Thick rich malt and dough quality mixing with a smattering of herbal bite that just pops in the mouth. Clean but full and rich filling on the finish, touches just a hair of sweetness but almost toying with your senses. Spreadable touches of bakery bread and green herbs all over. This might be one of the best Gerrman Helles I've ever had.\n",

      "L: Clear head with a small tight white head, moderate retention, and some lines of lacing. S: Super bright, golden bready, grainy as all get out with a light, crisp, honey sweetness--and just a faint touch of cool grassy/herbal hops. T: Nice golden bread upfront--almost tastes like lightly toasted white bread with just a bit of butter. A kiss of honey sweetness. There's a pop of cool and minty hops with some grass and lemon throughout. A nicely grainy flavor, too. Finishes very crisp and lightly dry  F: Light, but not watery. Medium-high carbonation pushes the beer quickly across the palate. It's lightly sweet throughout but ends crisp and clean.  O: This is an excellent refreshing lager. It's sort of between Munich Helles Lager and pilsner. It's a bit more hoppier than your typical Helles--leaning toward pilsner--but retains the firmly golden bready sweetness of a Helles.\n",

      "500 ml bottle into lager glass, best before 5/2017. Pours crystal clean pale golden yellow color with a small dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of cracker, biscuit, white bread, light honey, herbal, light pepper, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance of pale malt and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of cracker, biscuit, white bread, light honey, herbal, light pepper, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, light pepper, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great robustness and balance of pale malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness, lightly increasing through the glass. Very clean on lager flavors; touch of sulfur, but minimal fruity/yeasty notes present. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, bready/grainy, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is awesome. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5.2%. Overall this is an outstanding Munich helles! All around great robustness and balance of pale malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink. Very flavorful and well balanced for the ABV, and not too dry. A highly enjoyable offering, and fantastic style example.\n",

      "500ml bottle into a dimpled mug. Paid £2.39 for a single bottle. Pours a brilliantly clear, pale golden coloured body with masses of visible streaming carbonation. A two-finger in height, bubbly white head with excellent retention leaves behind a modest amount of fine lace. Crisp, faintly sweet, toasted grains lead above touches of hay and grassy hops to comprise the simple and delicate nose. Taste roughly follows suit. Pale malts, toasty grains and traces of wheat combine with hints of zesty lemon to lead the lightly sweet and bready flavour profile upfront. Hay and grassy hop profiles build from the mid-palate onwards, bringing a pleasant light bitterness to expertly balance initial malt sweetness. In the mouth, a light body and plentiful carbonation give a smooth and crisp feel, which make for incredibly easy drinking. Hop bitterness lingers momentarily before finishing quick, clean and dry on the palate. Overall this is a very good beer. Simple, but clean, crisp, delicate and well crafted. I am not usually a fan of the style, but it’s malty character, refreshing nature and insane drinkability mean I could certainly see myself picking up a couple of bottles to drink on a hot summers day.

      "500 ml bottle into lager glass, best before 5/2017. Pours crystal clean pale golden yellow color with a small dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of cracker, biscuit, white bread, light honey, herbal, light pepper, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance of pale malt and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of cracker, biscuit, white bread, light honey, herbal, light pepper, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, light pepper, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great robustness and balance of pale malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness, lightly increasing through the glass. Very clean on lager flavors; touch of sulfur, but minimal fruity/yeasty notes present. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, bready/grainy, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is awesome. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5.2%. Overall this is an outstanding Munich helles! All around great robustness and balance of pale malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink. Very flavorful and well balanced for the ABV, and not too dry. A highly enjoyable offering, and fantastic style example.\n",

      "500ml bottle into a dimpled mug. Paid £2.39 for a single bottle. Pours a brilliantly clear, pale golden coloured body with masses of visible streaming carbonation. A two-finger in height, bubbly white head with excellent retention leaves behind a modest amount of fine lace. Crisp, faintly sweet, toasted grains lead above touches of hay and grassy hops to comprise the simple and delicate nose. Taste roughly follows suit. Pale malts, toasty grains and traces of wheat combine with hints of zesty lemon to lead the lightly sweet and bready flavour profile upfront. Hay and grassy hop profiles build from the mid-palate onwards, bringing a pleasant light bitterness to expertly balance initial malt sweetness. In the mouth, a light body and plentiful carbonation give a smooth and crisp feel, which make for incredibly easy drinking. Hop bitterness lingers momentarily before finishing quick, clean and dry on the palate. Overall this is a very good beer. Simple, but clean, crisp, delicate and well crafted. I am not usually a fan of the style, but it’s malty character, refreshing nature and insane drinkability mean I could certainly see myself picking up a couple of bottles to drink on a hot summers day.

      "Clear gold with three fingers of egg shell head. Smell is bread crust malts and some herbal grassy hops. Taste is herbal grassy hops with good bread crust malts. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. Finish is lightly dry and balanced. Overall a delicious easy drinking lager. Canned on date 4/15/2019.\n",

      "L: thin honey with a thick, white, rapidly dissolving head. Slightly murky with a steady stream of small bubbles S: yeast, malt, fresh white bread T: balanced sweet malt with almost no hop presence to start with. Mild balanced hops towards the end, not enough to make this a hoppy brew, but enough to give it a clean, crisp finish. F: smooth and full bodied, medium carbonation with a little fizz on the tongue.  O: a very good helles in the, low hop, European tradition. A delicious, well rounded beer.\n",

      "Ah this beer has reached Oregon! 16 oz. can. From Lifesource natural Grocer in Salem OR $2.79 Pours a clear golden colour ( despite the can saying its unfiltered). Small yet persistant splotchy white head. Wow very authentic nose..bready, malty with a touch Saaz. Taste similat dries out in the finish. Nice clean malty mouth feel..semi dry finish adds to drnkability. Overall a very nice Export lager/helles..at last a contender here for Heater Allen\n",

      "Canned on 4/22/19 Pours a clear, deep gold body topped with multiple fingers of white foam; decent retention leaves a diverse smattering of thin, sudsy lacing along with an equally thin cap and collar. Aromas of fairly vivid, crisp straw with a backing of sweet biscuit and the further depth of toasted black bread crusts; floral/grassy hops hold prominence on the back end to round out the bouquet. Taste shows a notable hit of deep bread crust touched with hints of honeyed straw; grassy hops building toward the finish to accompany the smooth, malty sweetness spread through the profile. Mouthfeel presents a clean, crisp light-medium body, drying medium carbonation with a well-tempered grit in tow; finish remains dry and semi-crisp with a quenching ‘pop’ of malt and hops on the swallow that lingers quietly. Easy-drinking personified in this American take on a German Helles. I can’t help but think this lager would be what ‘macro’ brewers dream of, with an air of simple refinement and malt/hop balance taking quaffability to a new level.\n",

      "(12 oz can, part of variety pack, canned on 02/06/19... poured into simple glass mug) L: crystal-clear gold-colored liquid, fizzy white foam... no lasting collar, no lace S: lightly-toasty golden bread crust, similar to a soft pretzel; little bit of floral/grassy hop note T: lightly caramel-kissed robust pale malts; mild herbal/grassy hop flavor, mellow bitterness which gains a little edge from the aggressive carbonation; clean finish with a toasty-sweetish note lingering... does get more malty and tasty as it goes F: clean, crisp, smooth, with a lively carbonation and bit of viscous drag in its finish... refreshing bite; body gives it substance O: Helles is a bit of a stretch - this falls more between a malt liquor and a maibock perhaps... each of the 4 varieties from the mixed pack are serviceable, and I can't help but wonder whether the package was handled a bit improperly given that the foam from each looked terrible, rapidly collapsing, not lacing at all... again, probably go-tos in their home market, but won't convert me to a regular customer\n",

Pours slightly hazy/cloudy medium golden yellow color with a 1 finger dense and rocky white head with awesome retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts that whole glass. Nice thick soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of honey, white bread dough, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt and light earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of honey, white bread dough, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Very mild herbal/grassy hop bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of honey, white bread dough, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good robustness and balance of pale malt and light earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean finishing. Very slight dryness from bitterness. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, creamy/bready/grainy, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with zero yeast notes present. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.9%. Overall this is a very good Munich helles. All around good robustness and balance of pale malt and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink. A touch on the bland side for the style, but it's not watery. Nothing but clean pils malt flavors, with just enough hops to balance the sweetness. A very enjoyable offering, and spot on style example.\n",

They're both the beer that you don't plan to get into, but then something outdoors happens and you're in a group of people and someone has a Stiegl for you. At least that is how it played out numerous times in Milwaukee or its vicinity.  Pours a golden color, a little bit of haze to it, white 1/3\" head. Aroma of lager yeast, grain and a slight noble/saaz hop type aroma thing going on. Taste was a standard Euro lager kind of vibe. Light lager skunk yeast effect, mild hops, mild pilsner malt, barely toasted and bready. A undercurrent of sweetness similar to corn based lagers in the US. Difference being this is still a little bigger on the malt end, definitely doesn't have a mouth feel of anything but 100% barley.\n",

      "Revisited (6/3/19) from a bottle. Head shows decent retention - a thin velvety foam remains on top of the beer. Aroma has some nice bready malts, touch of sweetness, herbal hops with a hint of spiciness. Taste has notes of light cracker malts with just a hint of breadiness. Hint of honeysuckle sweetness, gives way to a light herbal/floral hop finish. Malt backbone is not quite as pronounced as one would like from a helles. Feel is light, easy drinking, smooth. Overall a solid American brewed helles - I always enjoy this one when I have it.  On draft - a \"helles style lager\" Pours a hazy opaque golden wheat color. Thin white head dissipates leaving a white film on the beer with tons of sticky lacing. Head retention isn't great. Smell has a grainy aroma with some corn notes and is noticeably sweet on the nose. Touch of white bread on the nose Taste follows the nose with a sweet flavor array of grain, bread, and corn as the beer warms. Sweetness throughout reminiscent of honey - in other words it doesn't taste like an artificial sugary sweetness - more of a mild honey sweetness. Touch of a mild hoppy finish dries out the sweetness and leaves a lingering malty flavor. Feel is pretty light and crisp. Easily drinkable. Medium carbonation. Dryish finish.  Overall a solid helles style lager. I didn't think the hops were as crisp or \"bright\" as I'd expect for a helles, but it's still a solid offering. 3.75 | 3.75 | 4 | 4 | 3.75 = 3.88\n",

It's crisp, clean, light and refreshing, everything that Helles should aspire to be.  It's a fine helles and being able to get it nice and fresh with minimal hassle, compared to German imports, is nice.

Hint of honeysuckle sweetness, gives way to a light herbal/floral hop finish. Malt backbone is not quite as pronounced as one would like from a helles. Feel is light, easy drinking, smooth.

Touch of white bread on the nose Taste follows the nose with a sweet flavor array of grain, bread, and corn as the beer warms. Sweetness throughout reminiscent of honey - in other words it doesn't taste like an artificial sugary sweetness - more of a mild honey sweetness. Touch of a mild hoppy finish dries out the sweetness and leaves a lingering malty flavor. Feel is pretty light and crisp. Easily drinkable. Medium carbonation. Dryish finish.

Aroma opens with barnyard hay and bread crust touched with lemon zest; malt and earthy spice begin to open further on, with hints of honeyed grain and cracker trailing through. Taste opens with light herbal hops and dried hay notes, eventually welcoming heavily earthy fruit rind and a beautiful tinge of grainy sweetness fading effortlessly to herbal straw on the swallow. Mouthfeel features a bright, lighter body elevated by a crisp malt and hop tingle building with the higher carbonation and peaking at drying finish. Intense drinkability and casual complexity define this Helles, which embraces hoppy subtlety with malty depth to round out an all-around balance in an exceptionally ‘bright’ beer.\n",

      "This will be my first entry of/in Happy Loads of New (Mainly) Lager Beers Sunday (Week 718). I purchased several bottles from von Trapp Brewing at Hunger-n-Thirst &amp; as the eradication of the Bottle Backlog here at Chez Woody rolls on, these are next in line.

The aroma is bready and biscuity, evoking freshly toasted malts and bread crusts. Bright citrusy hops aroma throughout.  Taste opens up clean and with dry malt flavors. The malt flavors open up to reveal a bready, toasty and biscuity quality, with a modest underlying sweetness, amidst moderate peppery, spicy and grassy hops flavors for balance. In addition, the bright citrusy hops flavors provide a lightly lemony middle palate. The hops bitterness is mild. The finish is slightly peppery, citrusy and dry.

First bottle I got a neutral grainy note with a little grape fruit influence. this second bottle, I am getting a more defined bready malt, but still leaning a little on raw malted grain. I don't get as fruity a note, but a little bit of a floral wine note with hopefully a promise of a grape leave to grassy bitterness. Taste hits on both the grape fruity note neutralized by a combination of grainy malt and a fresh vegetal greens bitterness. These all blend together in a nice way such that none stand out or are specifically unique. Late and lingering notes are a tad grassy, but the opening notes are alternatively more fruity/floral and grainy with each sip. A fairly soft, nicely carbonated light offering.

The Sixpoint and Von Trapp have a similar aroma, leaning a bit more to the sourdough side than the Victory, which smells a bit sweeter than either.

      "This will be my first entry of/in Happy Loads of New (Mainly) Lager Beers Sunday (Week 718). I purchased several bottles from von Trapp Brewing at Hunger-n-Thirst &amp; as the eradication of the Bottle Backlog here at Chez Woody rolls on, these are next in line.  From the Bottle: \"'A little of Austria[,] a lot of Vermont'\"; \"German for 'bright', our Helles is an easy-drinking, yet surprisingly complex, golden Lager\"; \"By the family that inspired 'The Sound of Music'\"; \"Brewed on the grounds of Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe, Vermont, this lager is crafted with the finest traditional ingredients and our pure Vermont spring water.\"; \"IBU: 20\". A Pop! of the cap, a slow, gentle C-Line pour &amp; I was off &amp; running. The head puffed up, forming two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, bone-white head with very good retention, leaving behind loads of lacing as a souvenir. Color was NOT \"Golden\", but instead, Straw-Yellow (SRM = &gt; 2, &lt; 4) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled like Summers at my maternal grandparents' house - freshly-baked bread cooled on the window sill as newly-mown hay &amp; grass wafted in on the breeze from a nearby working farm. Ah, youth. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium, not watery, but not far beyond it. That said, I would be a patented moron to be looking for a full-bodied Lager-style beer. What are you expecting? High viscosity? Ha! The taste closely followed the nose. It was not precisely sweet, but it was quite malty and very bready with just a hint of grassy Noble hops. Schlitz used to advertise as going with \"Just a kiss of the hops\" &amp; this beer seemed to be following in their footsteps. Me? I generally prefer a French Kiss of the hops, but that would have been entirely inappropriate in this beer. Finish was light, semi-dry, very refreshing &amp; if they were to put this in a CAN, it would definitely be a Summer cooler filler when headed to the beach.\n",

      "Pours a clear yellow straw color with a thumbnail length bubbly head. Good retention, including a sudsy layer of film and lacing throughout. The aroma is bready and biscuity, evoking freshly toasted malts and bread crusts. Bright citrusy hops aroma throughout.  Taste opens up clean and with dry malt flavors. The malt flavors open up to reveal a bready, toasty and biscuity quality, with a modest underlying sweetness, amidst moderate peppery, spicy and grassy hops flavors for balance. In addition, the bright citrusy hops flavors provide a lightly lemony middle palate. The hops bitterness is mild. The finish is slightly peppery, citrusy and dry. Light bodied, crisp, clean and with a moderate tingly carbonation.  Finely crafted and well balanced Helles Lager. Very tasty and drinkable.\n",

The head was weak, but a second bottle showed a solid, long lasting cap that even produce a little lacing. Gonna split the difference on score toward the more appealing, benefit of the doubt and all - could go higher... First bottle I got a neutral grainy note with a little grape fruit influence. this second bottle, I am getting a more defined bready malt, but still leaning a little on raw malted grain. I don't get as fruity a note, but a little bit of a floral wine note with hopefully a promise of a grape leave to grassy bitterness. Taste hits on both the grape fruity note neutralized by a combination of grainy malt and a fresh vegetal greens bitterness. These all blend together in a nice way such that none stand out or are specifically unique. Late and lingering notes are a tad grassy, but the opening notes are alternatively more fruity/floral and grainy with each sip. A fairly soft, nicely carbonated light offering. It is more fitting as a refreshing offering than a beer to sip and analyze, but isn't overly simple. The label description of \"bright\" seems to fit pretty well.\n",

A - Clear straw with a 1-finger white head and light lace S - Mild Pilsner malt, honey and light white grape.  T - Lightly toasted sourdough bread, herbal/metallic spice, lightly sweet with honey overtones and just a hint of white grape. Restrained bitterness; appropriate to style. M - Light-medium body and medium-high carbonation. Smooth then crisp mouthfeel. Finishes quite dry. O - Very true to style.  Notes: On 2018-04-08 I had this side-by-side with the new Sixpoint Alpenflo (Helles). Both were good. The Alpenflo had a richer malt profile and was creamier with less carbonation. This was a little sweeter, which is nice. I preferred the Alpenflo but would be glad to have either one on any given day. Notes: On 2018-04-27 I had this side-by-side with a Sixpoint Alpenflo and a Victory Helles. The Sixpoint and Von Trapp have a similar aroma, leaning a bit more to the sourdough side than the Victory, which smells a bit sweeter than either. This Victory sweetness comes through in the flavor, with an emphasis on white grape. The Sixpoint has a more complex, grainy base; less sweetness and greater carbonation than the Victory. The Von Trapp sits somewhere in-between; leaning more towards the Victory in terms of sweetness but at the same time, a little more bitter than the Victory.\n",

Light grain, sweet malt - hint of bread dough...Spicy and slightly floral hops. More bread dough malt character in the flavor straight off the bat then in the nose. Spicy hops lead to a drier finish. Medium body, medium carbonation perfect on this beer. Soft but substantial mouthfeel. Off dry finish, very close to dry keeps me ready for the next drink quickly.

The taste has added toasted bread, cracker, the citrus is mostly lemon and hop flavor is more pronounced as herbal and citrus. Semi-dry and mildly bitter, uniform throughout. A hint of apple juice appears. The finish is fast and crisp with a short hoppy aftertaste. Medium light body, average carbonation. Smooth and easy to have more than one. Alcohol is well hidden.

      "Best by 12/2/19 Pours a clear golden straw body topped with two fingers of soapy but dense white foam; good retention leaves behind a varied smattering of thinner lacing and a cap trickling from the walls of the glass. Aroma opens with barnyard hay and bread crust touched with lemon zest; malt and earthy spice begin to open further on, with hints of honeyed grain and cracker trailing through. Taste opens with light herbal hops and dried hay notes, eventually welcoming heavily earthy fruit rind and a beautiful tinge of grainy sweetness fading effortlessly to herbal straw on the swallow. Mouthfeel features a bright, lighter body elevated by a crisp malt and hop tingle building with the higher carbonation and peaking at drying finish. Intense drinkability and casual complexity define this Helles, which embraces hoppy subtlety with malty depth to round out an all-around balance in an exceptionally ‘bright’ beer.\n",

      "330 ml bottle into lager glass, best before 6/2019. Pours crystal clear medium golden/amber color with a 1 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey/corn, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. A bit of fruity corn aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice aromas with good balance of pale malt/corn and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey/corn, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey/corn, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great robustness and balance of pale malt/corn and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no lingering hop astringency after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Very clean on lager flavors, with minimal fruity/yeasty notes. Moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth and moderately bready/grainy/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol for 5.5%. Overall this is a delicious pale adjunct lager. All around nice robustness and balance of pale malt/corn and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, and fairly crisp/clean/refreshing to drink with the modestly bitter/drying finish. Very flavorful and not watery for the ABV. Very clean and nicely rich pils malt/grain showcase; with great earthy noble hop presence for the style. Not overdone on adjuncts. A very enjoyable offering, and impressive style example.\n",

S: An slight acetic acid aroma initially that gives way largely to bread rind and pepper. T: Dry. Watery, but with a bread rind flavor giving way to more of a light caramel. Peppery bitterness is a little strong consistent with a European take on American Adjuncts. Rather a bitter aftertaste limiting the generally thirst-quenching quality of the style.

      "BOTTLE: 500ml format. Purchased at a reputable beer store in Denver, CO for $3.99 USD. Brown glass with a pry-off crown cap. Appealing green label with a classic Bavarian motif. \"a classical Bavarian Vollbier (11.5% original extract and 4.8% alcohol by volume).\" \"Super Premium Bavarian Lager.\"  Served cold into a Paulaner pilsner glass. HEAD: Fills ~70% of the glass initially, retaining strong over a good 10+ minutes. Foamy, soft, and frothy, inviting the drinker's first sip. ~11cm in height. Leaves mild wisps of lacing as it recedes. Lively and enticing. BODY: Vibrant clear yellow. Obviously filtered, and boasting glorious clarity. Bright, clean, and lively. Looks solid for a Munich helles lager...easily a textbook appearance for the style. AROMA: Grassy Noble hops, biscuit, clean pilsner malt, minerals, fresh 2-row. A kiss of bread dough from German yeast. Not finding any toast or lemon. Has no off-notes based on the aroma. Suggests a clean easy drinking helles lager with no faults whatsoever. I'm eager to try it. Aromatic intensity is average (typical for the style). Seems mellow and approachable. TASTE &amp; TEXTURE: Clean yet husky, hitting on mellow yet crisp pale malts and 2-row/pilsner malt. It's refreshing but finishes surprisingly dry and coarse, encouraging the next sip. I get no toasty or Munich malt character from the malt backbone. Hop profile is grassy and a bit floral, seemingly classically Noble in character. Not fruity or lemony. Balanced if a bit neutral - certainly an approachable and inoffensive beer. It'd be easy to imagine quaffing it by the litre if not for its dry finish, which does impede its otherwise insane drinkability. Crisply carbonated yet soft on the palate. Light to medium-bodied with a clean mellow presence on the palate. Not oily, gushed, hot, boozy, astringent, harsh, or scratchy. I do wish it didn't finish so rough, but I doubt it'd be as such if I tried it fresh on-draught. OVERALL: A delightfully drinkable well-balanced helles lager that adheres about as firmly to traditional style conventions as probably any beer out there. I have to imagine it's a marvelous beer fresh on-draught, as even the bottle I bought in Colorado that's sat on shelves for who knows how long at tepid temperatures is still drinking real nice, but my current rating reflects the state of the beer as it is. I'd encourage Andechs to do transparent date coding and to advise retailers to refrigerate. Definitely a beer I'd love to revisit back in Germany. B (3.61) / GOOD Would pair well with a buttered (soft) pretzel. Serve quite cold.\n",

Aroma has notes of grain, malts – somewhat bready, a touch of light honey like sweetness. A subtle hint of a floral hop note is present, albeit faint. As the beer warms there is also a subtle hint of sulfur, but very light and in no way distracting.  Taste has notes of bready malts, almost lightly toasted. There is a slight hint of sweetness in the flavor, but it is very slight. That hint of sulfur comes through in the flavor. Slight hop bitterness – floral in nature, what you’d expect from noble hops comes through on the back end to the finish. Medium bodied. Vibrant carbonation provides a spritzy feel. Semi-dry to dry finish. Overall this is probably my favorite helles lager and a regular in my fridge.\n",

However, the sweetness is balanced nicely by the hoppy bitterness, leading to a satisfying, fairly dry and lightly bitter, clean finish.

The mouthfeel was between light and medium bodied with a very good sessionability about it (I could pound this all day if I wanted to).

      "BOTTLE: 500ml format. Purchased at a reputable beer store in Denver, CO for $3.99 USD. Brown glass with a pry-off crown cap. Appealing green label with a classic Bavarian motif. \"a classical Bavarian Vollbier (11.5% original extract and 4.8% alcohol by volume).\" \"Super Premium Bavarian Lager.\"  Served cold into a Paulaner pilsner glass. HEAD: Fills ~70% of the glass initially, retaining strong over a good 10+ minutes. Foamy, soft, and frothy, inviting the drinker's first sip. ~11cm in height. Leaves mild wisps of lacing as it recedes. Lively and enticing. BODY: Vibrant clear yellow. Obviously filtered, and boasting glorious clarity. Bright, clean, and lively. Looks solid for a Munich helles lager...easily a textbook appearance for the style. AROMA: Grassy Noble hops, biscuit, clean pilsner malt, minerals, fresh 2-row. A kiss of bread dough from German yeast. Not finding any toast or lemon. Has no off-notes based on the aroma. Suggests a clean easy drinking helles lager with no faults whatsoever. I'm eager to try it. Aromatic intensity is average (typical for the style). Seems mellow and approachable. TASTE &amp; TEXTURE: Clean yet husky, hitting on mellow yet crisp pale malts and 2-row/pilsner malt. It's refreshing but finishes surprisingly dry and coarse, encouraging the next sip. I get no toasty or Munich malt character from the malt backbone. Hop profile is grassy and a bit floral, seemingly classically Noble in character. Not fruity or lemony. Balanced if a bit neutral - certainly an approachable and inoffensive beer. It'd be easy to imagine quaffing it by the litre if not for its dry finish, which does impede its otherwise insane drinkability. Crisply carbonated yet soft on the palate. Light to medium-bodied with a clean mellow presence on the palate. Not oily, gushed, hot, boozy, astringent, harsh, or scratchy. I do wish it didn't finish so rough, but I doubt it'd be as such if I tried it fresh on-draught. OVERALL: A delightfully drinkable well-balanced helles lager that adheres about as firmly to traditional style conventions as probably any beer out there. I have to imagine it's a marvelous beer fresh on-draught, as even the bottle I bought in Colorado that's sat on shelves for who knows how long at tepid temperatures is still drinking real nice, but my current rating reflects the state of the beer as it is. I'd encourage Andechs to do transparent date coding and to advise retailers to refrigerate. Definitely a beer I'd love to revisit back in Germany.

      "Poured from bottle into a pint glass Appearance – The beer pours a lightly hazed medium golden colored beer with one finger of foamy white head. The head fades over about a 5 min time period, leaving a good level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma is wheaty and grainy smelling with a little bit of a citrus and grassy hop aroma mixed within.  Taste – The taste begins with a nice bready and doughy flavor with a decent amount of a sweet caramel flavor. These flavors create a nice smooth base for the brew, lasting till the end. Along with the aforementioned flavors, some flavors of yeast and lighter fruit flavors join the tongue. Toward the end a bit of a lemon taste as well as some light hop flavors of an herbal nature join the tongue. With just a hint of graininess and pepper joining the tongue at the very end a nice crisp yet smooth sweet and malty flavor is left to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the thinner side with a carbonation that is rather high. Both are fantastic for the mix of bread, sweet, and hop, creating a very refreshing and quite drinkable brew.  Overall -This one is nice and refreshing a great session style brew. One I will certainly get again.\n",

      "Had this on 2012-12-25 and again on 2018-05-13 in Columbia, PA A - Midly-hazy with a 1.5 finger white head that fades pretty quickly and leaves mild lacing. S - Bread dough, lemon candy, flowery hops, light yeast. T - Plenty of Pils malt, grass, lemon candy and hint of white grape, perfect balancing bitterness in the finish. M - Light-medium body and medium-high carbonation. Crisp, sprightly and refreshing. O - Top notch Helles. I've been doing a lot of Helles comparisons in 2018 and have a more educated palate about this style than I did in 2012. I've raised my ratings accordingly.  The original review from 2012-12-25 is below: 3.75, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0 for a 3.94 overall A - Midly-hazy with a 1.5 finger white head that fades pretty quickly and leaves mild lacing. S - Bread dough, lemon, flowery hops, light yeast. T - Pale malt, grass, biscuit, lemon, hop spice, light white pepper, good medium-lived tart citrus and bittering finish. M - Light-medium body and medium-high carbonation. Crisp, sprightly and refreshing. O - A very well-done Helles with plenty of quality aromas and taste in a session beer.  Notes: On 2018-05-13 and 2018-05-27 I had Alpenflo side-by-side with Pennsylvania Brewing Company's \"Penn Gold\", which just won the Gold Medal for Muenchner-Style Helles at the 2018 World Beer Cup. The aromas are very similar although the Alpenflo sourdough-bready aroma is a little stronger than the malt aroma of the Penn Gold, which smells a little sweeter. The similarities and differences carry over into the tastes. Both have a wonderful, bready malt flavor. There's a hint of white grape and honey in both beers. The Penn Gold finishes a little sweeter spicier than the Alpenflo, which like the aroma, leans more towards a slight sourdough finish. It's worth noting the Penn Gold has a lower ABV at 4.5%. Both are excellent. The sweetness of the Penn Gold is on par with Weihenstephaner \"Original\" (Helles). Alpenflo is clearly a world class beer and I expect it to be a medal winner too; perhaps at this year's (2018) GABF.\n",

      "Poured from bottle into a pint glass Appearance – The beer pours a lightly hazed medium golden colored beer with one finger of foamy white head. The head fades over about a 5 min time period, leaving a good level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma is wheaty and grainy smelling with a little bit of a citrus and grassy hop aroma mixed within.  Taste – The taste begins with a nice bready and doughy flavor with a decent amount of a sweet caramel flavor. These flavors create a nice smooth base for the brew, lasting till the end. Along with the aforementioned flavors, some flavors of yeast and lighter fruit flavors join the tongue. Toward the end a bit of a lemon taste as well as some light hop flavors of an herbal nature join the tongue. With just a hint of graininess and pepper joining the tongue at the very end a nice crisp yet smooth sweet and malty flavor is left to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the thinner side with a carbonation that is rather high. Both are fantastic for the mix of bread, sweet, and hop, creating a very refreshing and quite drinkable brew.  Overall -This one is nice and refreshing a great session style brew. One I will certainly get again.\n",

S - Bread dough, lemon candy, flowery hops, light yeast. T - Plenty of Pils malt, grass, lemon candy and hint of white grape, perfect balancing bitterness in the finish. M - Light-medium body and medium-high carbonation. Crisp, sprightly and refreshing. O - Top notch Helles. I've been doing a lot of Helles comparisons in 2018 and have a more educated palate about this style than I did in 2012. I've raised my ratings accordingly.

O: This is a very good American representation of a Munich Helles Lager, although it seems a bit lighter compared to some of the German counterparts. In that aspect, it is very easy to drink. Serving type: bottle\n",

      "Pours light gold. High clarity. Minimal head. Smells of hay, straw, German malt. Grassy and some spice. Taste follows with grassy earthy overtones with bready malt and some sweetness. Some lemony citrus flavor to balance out the malt profile. Low bitterness but just enough. All put together well. Very light body and medium carbonation. A touch of aftertaste but doesn't ruin anything. Refreshing. Wasn't having high expectations since German lagers haven't hit my taste to well. Bit this one is different. It packs a lot of flavor in a low abv. and very good balance. Well crafted for sure. I'll grab some more of these, especially for daytime summer drinking.\n",

      "Poured from bottle into a pint glass Appearance – The beer pours a lightly hazed medium golden colored beer with one finger of foamy white head. The head fades over about a 5 min time period, leaving a good level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma is wheaty and grainy smelling with a little bit of a citrus and grassy hop aroma mixed within.  Taste – The taste begins with a nice bready and doughy flavor with a decent amount of a sweet caramel flavor. These flavors create a nice smooth base for the brew, lasting till the end. Along with the aforementioned flavors, some flavors of yeast and lighter fruit flavors join the tongue. Toward the end a bit of a lemon taste as well as some light hop flavors of an herbal nature join the tongue. With just a hint of graininess and pepper joining the tongue at the very end a nice crisp yet smooth sweet and malty flavor is left to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the thinner side with a carbonation that is rather high. Both are fantastic for the mix of bread, sweet, and hop, creating a very refreshing and quite drinkable brew.  Overall -This one is nice and refreshing a great session style brew. One I will certainly get again.\n",

      "Had this on 2012-12-25 and again on 2018-05-13 in Columbia, PA A - Midly-hazy with a 1.5 finger white head that fades pretty quickly and leaves mild lacing. S - Bread dough, lemon candy, flowery hops, light yeast. T - Plenty of Pils malt, grass, lemon candy and hint of white grape, perfect balancing bitterness in the finish. M - Light-medium body and medium-high carbonation. Crisp, sprightly and refreshing. O - Top notch Helles. I've been doing a lot of Helles comparisons in 2018 and have a more educated palate about this style than I did in 2012. I've raised my ratings accordingly.  The original review from 2012-12-25 is below: 3.75, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0 for a 3.94 overall A - Midly-hazy with a 1.5 finger white head that fades pretty quickly and leaves mild lacing. S - Bread dough, lemon, flowery hops, light yeast. T - Pale malt, grass, biscuit, lemon, hop spice, light white pepper, good medium-lived tart citrus and bittering finish. M - Light-medium body and medium-high carbonation. Crisp, sprightly and refreshing. O - A very well-done Helles with plenty of quality aromas and taste in a session beer.  Notes: On 2018-05-13 and 2018-05-27 I had Alpenflo side-by-side with Pennsylvania Brewing Company's \"Penn Gold\", which just won the Gold Medal for Muenchner-Style Helles at the 2018 World Beer Cup. The aromas are very similar although the Alpenflo sourdough-bready aroma is a little stronger than the malt aroma of the Penn Gold, which smells a little sweeter. The similarities and differences carry over into the tastes. Both have a wonderful, bready malt flavor. There's a hint of white grape and honey in both beers. The Penn Gold finishes a little sweeter spicier than the Alpenflo, which like the aroma, leans more towards a slight sourdough finish. It's worth noting the Penn Gold has a lower ABV at 4.5%. Both are excellent. The sweetness of the Penn Gold is on par with Weihenstephaner \"Original\" (Helles). Alpenflo is clearly a world class beer and I expect it to be a medal winner too; perhaps at this year's (2018) GABF.\n",

      "Poured from a 24 oz can into a flute.  Overall, this a really enjoyable beer. Clean, light, crisp, with a lot of flavor. Not overly bitter at the finish, not overly sweet at the start. Straw and hay on the nose and at the start. Sweet and yeasty bread at the start, good balance and finish with a touch of hops bitterness. Good head retention for a bit. Nice and foamy. I appreciate the consistency of this beer. No off flavors. Very clean.\n",

      "Poured from the can into a Libbey style pilsner glass. Deep straw body color, with a hint dark brass and excellent clarity. Ultra fine carbonation rising slowly to meet a simple bleach white head. Head manages about three solid fingers, and leaves a good half finger thick puck while settling. Very nice dough bread like malts on the nose, with a touch of crisp quality. Clean aroma. Not much of a hop sensing presence. Just fairly solid for a lager. Palate takes some interesting surprises. Somewhat light bodied even for a helles, but manages a more surprising palate. Mid flavors of a bit of powder grain, and touches almost it seems an American fruit hop angle on the finish just slightly. Subsequent sips bring this out a little more, with hints of a stone fruit almost apricot/peach quality. Interesting take on a helles, but something seems to be missing. Still enjoyable.\n",

The taste is bready, malty with some sweetness. The finish has a subtle, floral hop dryness that lingers in the back of the throat. Medium mouthfeel. In my experience, lagers don't tend to \"wow.\" And that's okay. This American take on the Helles style is smooth, easy drinking.\n",

Nice lager-like aroma of toasted barley grain, cereal malts, and clean floral hop sensations.  It is a light bodied beer that is smooth on the palate and easy to drink. A sweet toasted bread taste is the main character I pick up with a clean, floral hop dryness to complete it. It looks, acts, and tastes like a pale lager should.\n",

Taste: Pale biscuit flour and sourdough bread. Some honeysuckle. Not too sweet nor grainy. No wheat or gain, just pale white flour, sugar, and light honeysuckle. No apparent hop bitterness. Finish: Medium bodied-actually quite heavier than I was expecting for 4.5% ABV. Moderate carbonation. Finishes clean, not too crisp. No apparent hop bitterness or astringency. Overall: A delicious German Helles lager. Pale biscuit malt focused. Drinks heavier and satisfying, but not sweet. It's like taking a drink of biscuit dough.\n",

      "Pours quite beautifully into the prescribed flute. Hazy gold with plenty of active carbonation and a white, fluffy, loose head that dissipates pretty quickly. Smell is of sweet malts, but there is some balanced breadiness and even a bit of clean grassiness there to balance out that sweetness. The flavor is very nice. This is a beer that is well-balanced between the sweet breadiness of the malt and some fresh tartness from the hops. Mouthfeel is right at average, and makes this a beer that would be easy to pound. Overall, while this may not be the most interesting style, the beer itself is not boring, and is quite enjoyable.\n",

Nice mix of Pilsner malt and hops, with a lean towards the floral with a light dry grass aspect in the nose. Taste has a bit less of a bready malt note than expected from the nose. Light metallic aspect as the more bitter than expected hops hit. It’s not a very bitter beer, just the floral nature had me expecting less green grass and a lighter, floral hop influence.

      "12oz can - always nice to see a straight-up lager from an established craft brewery. This beer pours a clear, pale golden yellow colour, with four fingers of puffy, rocky, and mildly fizzy off-white head, which leaves some decent spotty lace around the glass as it slowly sinks out of sight. It smells of bready and crackery cereal malt, clove honey, a hint of gasohol, and some tame earthy, grassy, and floral green hop bitters. The taste is gritty and grainy pale malt, a touch of toastiness, honeyed crackers, faded petrol esters, and more understated leafy, herbal, and floral noble hoppiness. The carbonation is adequate in its palate-satiating frothiness, the body a so-so medium weight, and generally smooth, with nothing in particular getting in the way of a swell time at this point in the process. It finishes trending dry, and crisp, with the graininess predominating. Overall - this comes across as a pleasantly rendered version of the style, nice and malty with a subtle hop off-set. As the marketing blurb sez, lagers are made for drinking, as opposed to thinking, and by extension, writing. Maybe that's why I'm having trouble finding more good things to say about this offering, and I mean that in a nice way.\n",

Nice mix of Pilsner malt and hops, with a lean towards the floral with a light dry grass aspect in the nose. Taste has a bit less of a bready malt note than expected from the nose. Light metallic aspect as the more bitter than expected hops hit. It’s not a very bitter beer, just the floral nature had me expecting less green grass and a lighter, floral hop influence. Carbonation is prickly and moderately strong. Body is light, and fairly clean, with just a light herbal lingering note.\n",

      "12oz can - always nice to see a straight-up lager from an established craft brewery. This beer pours a clear, pale golden yellow colour, with four fingers of puffy, rocky, and mildly fizzy off-white head, which leaves some decent spotty lace around the glass as it slowly sinks out of sight. It smells of bready and crackery cereal malt, clove honey, a hint of gasohol, and some tame earthy, grassy, and floral green hop bitters. The taste is gritty and grainy pale malt, a touch of toastiness, honeyed crackers, faded petrol esters, and more understated leafy, herbal, and floral noble hoppiness. The carbonation is adequate in its palate-satiating frothiness, the body a so-so medium weight, and generally smooth, with nothing in particular getting in the way of a swell time at this point in the process. It finishes trending dry, and crisp, with the graininess predominating. Overall - this comes across as a pleasantly rendered version of the style, nice and malty with a subtle hop off-set. As the marketing blurb sez, lagers are made for drinking, as opposed to thinking, and by extension, writing.

This is a beer that is well-balanced between the sweet breadiness of the malt and some fresh tartness from the hops. Mouthfeel is right at average, and makes this a beer that would be easy to pound.

Still new to this style with this just being my third review of a Munich Helles Lager. Did not look at the ratings of this until I got home and let’s just say they are not good. But $1.00 for 16.9 ounces, so let’s have some fun.  Poured a pale clear color with 2-to-3 fingers of rocky white head. Lots of slow moving bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Good watery, spotty lacing. Very good retention. (Sight - 3.75) Smelled grain, metallic notes, buttered corn, cereal, herbal, dark green apple, pear and bready malts. (Smell - 3.25) Taste followed the nose, but much worse overall. Got grainy metallic notes, cereal, buttered corn, raw veggies, dry grass, dark green apple, light pear and barley. (Taste - 2.50) Light body. Thin texture. Average carbonation. Abrupt, metallic finish. (Feel - 2.50) Did not like this beer. Even for the price, would probably not purchase it again. Below average.

T: full grainy flavour with mild hops bitterness on the finish. Generally just loads of barley. Liquid bread. Mild metallic aftertaste thanks to the can.  F: found the carbonation came back as I drank it. Seems to come alive when it moves. Heavier than American lagers.  O: I really enjoyed this. I don't commonly see it in Ontario but will purchase again. Love the grainy taste, and minimal skunk that I'm accustomed to with Bitburger etc. Will try again with a tall glass to see if it affects carbonation and feel.\n",

It's a nice yellow gold though beneath a short head of bright white foam. The head retention doesn't seem to be too good but we'll see. In the nose it's hoppy with floral and herbal notes over a sweetish malt base. It smells like pilsner malt. In the taste the malt comes through clearer and I'd definitely say it's pilsner malt, but being a Munich-style helles there's probably some Munich malt in there as well. It's sweet and grainy, lightly bready, slightly fruity with some apple, and threaded through with lemony and grassy hops. It's lightly floral as well, and I then I get the herbal hop component in the lingering aftertaste. A median bitterness balances it and it's more on the sweet and malty side than anything else except for a bump in the end. It's easy to drink though, and not so sweet that it becomes cloying. In the mouth it's medium-light in body and gently crisp then smooth - I'd really expect a little bit more body out of a Munich-style helles, but OK. The head didn't really hold up that well, and the lacing was fairly limited. Combined with the haze that hurts it on appearance. The label didn't say it was unfiltered, did it? That would make it a kellerbier anyway. Overall it's pretty nice though, maybe a little on the sweet side, but easy drinking and satisfying.  Review# 6,299\n",

      "Crisp, clean and highly refreshing, the Devil's Backbone brewers hang their hat on a no frills, classic light German lager that's satisfying and nonpolarizing.  Pale straw and brilliantly clear, Gold Leaf Lager streams with radiant effervescence and builds a cottony white froth. Spicy and floral, the nose is pleasantly grainy with grass and a light drift of potpourri. Light malt sweetness trends bready but dry like fresh baked wafers as the zesty lager hits the tongue. A quick middle palate swiftly sheds its pilsner malt sweetness and a crisp cracker-like dryness ensues. What starts floral turns spicy with aspects of lemon pepper, lemon grass and verbena. Mild apple esters mingle on the tastebuds before the grassy finish gives a pepper balance to close. Light in body, the early textures are creamy, but the texture quickly turns dry, drinkable and effortless on the palate. A mild linger of raw grain and hop spice resonates briefly on the after palate.\n",

      "Can number five from this six-pack; canning date is February 18th, 2016. The beer is -- as expected -- golden in color, and very clear. There's a good number of rising bubbles coming up from the bottom. There was a thin head of white foam on top at first but this went away pretty quickly, leaving only a very thin ring around the edges and a few scattered bits here and there. I remember a bit more foam happening on previous cans, so this is probably my fault (I may have poured a little more carefully than usual this time, for some odd reason.) Overall it's a pretty nice-looking beer. Smell is very lager-y. There's some breadiness in there, and a background sweetness showing up at the very end, along with the lager-yeast type smell that I'm not entirely sure how to describe in any way other than that. Not noticing any obvious signs of hops, but a Helles is supposed to be a more malt-focused beer than, say, a pilsner so that seems normal. Fairly mild smell to this one but what's there is pretty good. Taste is similar to the smell but ramped up to a higher level -- lots of nice breadiness right away, with the sweetness mixing in here and there. Richer bread in the initial taste of it, more of a white-bread sort of thing lingering in the aftertaste. Again no obvious signs of hops, but they're doing their part by balancing against the sweetness as the beer turns out fairly dry overall. Around the halfway mark I pick up a bit of a dried-grass sort of thing in there, not sure if that's a flavor from the hops (or hops/malt blend) or just the malt alone. It's a simple beer but a very tasty one. Feel is fairly light, pretty bubbly but not quite reaching fizzy/prickly range. Very easy to drink quickly, and that combined with the lower-than-average ABV means this is a beer that lends itself to drinking more than one (I'm almost through the glass already, actually -- if I didn't need to be at work by 3 today I could easily have another.) Works pretty well for the beer but doesn't particularly stand out. Overall, this is a nice little beer that I'm glad I finally picked up a six-pack of -- it may just be one of the most rapidly-vanishing six-packs I've ever had! Devil's Backbone has a reputation of making good lagers on this site, and for good reason -- I'll always appreciate having fresh six-packs of beers like this one and their Vienna Lager readily available just about anywhere I go where I live.\n",

      "Can number five from this six-pack; canning date is February 18th, 2016. The beer is -- as expected -- golden in color, and very clear. There's a good number of rising bubbles coming up from the bottom. There was a thin head of white foam on top at first but this went away pretty quickly, leaving only a very thin ring around the edges and a few scattered bits here and there. I remember a bit more foam happening on previous cans, so this is probably my fault (I may have poured a little more carefully than usual this time, for some odd reason.) Overall it's a pretty nice-looking beer. Smell is very lager-y. There's some breadiness in there, and a background sweetness showing up at the very end, along with the lager-yeast type smell that I'm not entirely sure how to describe in any way other than that. Not noticing any obvious signs of hops, but a Helles is supposed to be a more malt-focused beer than, say, a pilsner so that seems normal. Fairly mild smell to this one but what's there is pretty good. Taste is similar to the smell but ramped up to a higher level -- lots of nice breadiness right away, with the sweetness mixing in here and there. Richer bread in the initial taste of it, more of a white-bread sort of thing lingering in the aftertaste. Again no obvious signs of hops, but they're doing their part by balancing against the sweetness as the beer turns out fairly dry overall. Around the halfway mark I pick up a bit of a dried-grass sort of thing in there, not sure if that's a flavor from the hops (or hops/malt blend) or just the malt alone. It's a simple beer but a very tasty one. Feel is fairly light, pretty bubbly but not quite reaching fizzy/prickly range. Very easy to drink quickly, and that combined with the lower-than-average ABV means this is a beer that lends itself to drinking more than one (I'm almost through the glass already, actually -- if I didn't need to be at work by 3 today I could easily have another.) Works pretty well for the beer but doesn't particularly stand out. Overall, this is a nice little beer that I'm glad I finally picked up a six-pack of -- it may just be one of the most rapidly-vanishing six-packs I've ever had!

As the beer sits it will also show you some pepper and spice. No diacetyl, no fruity esters from yeast, faint dms perfect for the style. Drinks smoothly and imo better than last year. No rough edges on this one it goes down with plenty of satisfaction. Hops remain shy on the palate but they impart their cool breath to the beer. Finishes perfectly.

The flavors are much as expected from the nose with the bready malt, brightened by a touch of lemon, and with the earthy, herbal flavors of the hops showing more strongly. There's also a solid bitterness prominent in the mix. The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium bodied and the moderate carbonation adds a touch of prickly crispness. The finish begins fairly early as the bready character disappears, leaving the field to the earthy, herbal bitterness from the hops. The touch of lemon zest seems to persist quite a while as the bitterness gradually fades into dryness that invites another sip.

The touch of lemon zest seems to persist quite a while as the bitterness gradually fades into dryness that invites another sip. On the whole this seems a well made example of the style, but with perhaps just a touch too much bitterness. I'd be happy to have another, That said I think I'd give the nod to the Victory Helles Lager over this one as this one seems just a touch more heavy handed.\n",

      "Southern Tier Why the Helles Not Pours clear and golden with a fast falling head of white creamy foam. Nose is light and golden with malt. By light I mean that the malt is not complex. It is golden and breaddy but does not offer any toasted flavor. Hops are just present on the nose but shy. Soft floral shows a bit of grass from hops. As the beer sits it will also show you some pepper and spice. No diacetyl, no fruity esters from yeast, faint dms perfect for the style. Drinks smoothly and imo better than last year. No rough edges on this one it goes down with plenty of satisfaction. Hops remain shy on the palate but they impart their cool breath to the beer. Finishes perfectly. Malty with a crisp bubble and just a little bitterness to linger. Exemplary! In fact I would say put this up against any German import.\n",

O: [3.50] This has a bunch of flavor for a 4.6% lager. It doesn't have the standard lager cardboard/corn taste that I always seem to detect. The caramel/toffee flavor is nice.

      "Bottle poured into a pilsner glass. The bottling date marks this as a fairly old beer, so I may re-review when it's fresh. Moerlein's lager pours a fairly standard \"lager\" color - transparent, clear gold with a soapy white head that fades quickly. There's active carbonation from the bottom of the glass but little lacing left behind. Meh. While many would expect an adjunct-like smell based on appearance, Moerlein's Helles boasts its traditional recipe proudly: Bready pils malts, a touch of honey, and spicy European hops. There is a touch of sourness lingering in the background that grows as the beer warms, but I tend to expect that with some of these styles. Not bad, just a little bland. The taste on this is not bad. It is refreshing if nothing else, with a nice spicy bitterness on the finish with plenty of buttery and bready malts to provide some sweetness. The sourness does tend to linger but washes away fairly quickly. Overall, a fairly balanced and tasty, just not an absolute stand-out beer. Moerlein does better than this, I think. For what it's worth, though, this is a good transition beer. Helles Lagers' mouthfeel has a crisp and dry carbonation with a fairly light body. The sourness on the finish fades fairly quickly. It is a very good summer beer, I think. While not Moerlein's best, this is still okay for giving to your BMC-drinking friends at tailgates or house parties. It's a good transition beer, as I said... or if you don't necessarily want to go all-out for your regular go-to beer, this might suit you.\n",

Long before the Micro Boom® this Cincy beer (now brewed in Wilkes Barre, PA) was a frequent purchase when looking for something \"different.\" A -- Pours a clear golden color with a dense white head that holds up well. Very nice to style. S -- Spicy, noble hops and very vague DMS. Rather mild all around. T -- Spicy hops up front with a bready, yet somewhat sour-ish mid character -- sort of reminds me of the Sam Adams yeast character. Funny thing is, I seem to remember this unique flavor from beers of the past. Not sure if CM was one of those back then, but it's a nostalgic kick. Finishes with that mix of spiciness and yeastiness. Aftertaste is spicy hops. M -- Mouthfeel is crisp with a medium-light body. O -- Overall I like this beer. It's not the perfect Helles, but the nostalgic flavor seems to have grabbed me.

      "The Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is the BEST “standard ale” for taste, appearance and feel. It’s hard to believe it’s a “daily beer” for the amazing quality of taste and aroma and texture. No beer can touch this one for a daily drink ale. The Sierra Nevada hoppier ales (like the Little Hazy Thing and Celebration Ale) kick it up a notch with more highlights, but are truly a more “special brew” style not a daily brew to enjoy. My personal favorite for an ALWAYS tasty brew year round!\n",

      "Sierra Nevada's flagship product, Pale Ale, is that one beer for me that delivers every single time. It embodies almost everything I look for, and especially what I expect, from a beer: freshness, character, lasting enjoyment from first to last sip, and the ability to stand up to a hearty meal. From the clean amber color to the lovely floral scent, the piney elements in the full-bodied taste, it is my 'house' beer, hands down.\n",

      "A balanced classic that's a benchmark for the style but ultimately nothing special in 2018. It has a vaguely macro lager-y feel to it even though it's nicely hoppy, with citrus peel notes. Balancing caramel malt. Tastes like a hoppy Yeungling.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.9\n",
      "Pours a clear, deep gold/light amber coloration with a medium, fizzy head. Smells faintly of biscuity, bready malt, with a certain graininess coming through as well and the merest hint of citrus and pine. Taste is a good balance of biscuity malt and citrus hops, with just a hint of pine coming through and an underlaying grainy and slightly flowery note. Finishes with crisp, light/medium bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel with a light/medium body and medium carbonation. I wasn't gonna review this as first, as my bottle is a good six months old. However, reading the other reviews and knowing that SN are actually masters of brewing beers that keep well, I feel that the beer is actually supposed to have this slightly understated malt/hop presence, which is kind of typical of a classic, old school Pale Ale, I suppose. It's well balanced, crisp and easy-drinking, but lacks a certain bite and doesn't really seem that special. Maybe it really is better fresh, who knows. EDIT: Having an 11 week old bottle now and while it does have that understated aroma/flavour to it, the citrus notes do seem somewhat more vibrant than I remember them.\n",

I’m still getting that semi sweet almost vanilla character on the finish, underlying the bitter hop flavor Overall this is one of my favorite APA’s I’ve had.

      "Really grateful to FBarber for hooking me up with this highly acclaimed beer via trade. I had it once on tap as a nightcap. Let’s see what it tastes like on a fresh palate. Pours an amber color with an orange hue. light haze and moderate head that displays good retention. It’s not the most special looking beer ever, but the appearance does hint at a solid body. The aroma opens with a delicious burst of citrus and tropical fruit. Notes of tangerine, freshly squeezed orange juice, grapefruit, pineapple, mango, papaya and even a hint of banana. Aromas of caramel malt foresee a solid malt base to come. Amidst all of this, a wonderful pungent layer of herbal aromas, pine, grass and dank, delight the nose. From the start, the taste opens up with earthy hops flavors, piny, resiny and dank. The palate opens dry with a significant yet clean bitterness. Flavors begin to open up, particularly the interplay between malts and hops. A firm bready and caramel malt backbone adds body, roundness and moderate sweetness. A juicy burst of citrus fruit, grapefruit rind, orange pith, and a touch of lemon fills the palate. Also, notes of tropical fruit, pineapple and mango compliment the malts and other hops flavors. Delightfully sublime taste overall, supremely balanced and dynamic. Medium bodied, moderately carbonated and smooth overall. Resiny, bitter and dry finish begs for more sips. I could crush multiple bottles. This beer is a true work of art. Finely crafted and supremely balanced. I don’t buy into all of this nonsense that its time has come and that newer beer trends have surpassed it. This magical elixir is, simply put, a delicious classic that has the ability to stand the test of time and outlast passing fads. Well worth the hype!\n",

      "Two plus finger head of light tan to cream white, extremely thick and barely moves for some time, the lacing slowly tears off from the head, more random splotches than streaks. Dark bronze orange colored liquid, faint haze, the bubbles are tiny but swirl upwards with rapidity. Malts ground the nose with mocha, dark chocolate to challah bread notes, then spiced oranges, pine cone, tarry earth and just cut onions, leafy dankness, oddly the papaya, nectarine, pear scents never really factor in and it might be easy to not even notice this element. Full-bodied, creamy texture, fills the mouth from cheek to cheek, borderline heavy. The carbonation is a little better than average but not especially refreshing. Loaded with honeyed tangerine to grapefruit citrus as well as sticky pine sap, in turn the Saltine cracker and charred pizza crust notes substantial. Malted milk balls, bitter chocolate with less intense caramel. Much more floral at the finish and retronasally. The apricot, peach, pineapple, pear fruit remains lowkey but consistent in that. Smooth for its weight and the relatively low ABV helps drinkability. Worth seeking out.\n",

      "Bottled 16 days ago and had alongside a 3.5-week-old can of PseudoSue. L -- Pours a pale golden color with the slightest bit of haze and a 2-finger head produced with moderately aerated pour. Some retention and good lacing. S -- Pineapple, earth, candied grapefruit, papaya, mango, cannabis, and a hint of that rubber hops smell too T -- Big earthy and grassy flavors upfront, rounded out by cracker malts and hints of tropical fruit and dank pine resin F -- Nice, well-rounded mouthfeel, especially given the fairly low ABV. Crisp and refreshing. Medium carb and medium mouthfeel. Finishes dry with a restrained bitterness O -- My main complaint with this and all other citra-centric beers I've had is that the aromas and flavors are heavy on the grassy/earthy characteristics. I'm personally more of a fruit-forward hop guy (galaxy and mosaic topping my list), and I think I subconsciously equate any sort of harsh grassiness with 'old'. Still, this is an absolute joy to drink and I'm glad to have located a bottle during a five hour train layover in Chicago 87/100\n",

      "Hoppy, clean, classic. Six pack bottled on 5/30, drank within four weeks. Tons of great reviews available so I'll keep it brief and stick to the highlights - floral and citrus aroma bursts forth from beneath the cap. Amber hue with a nice thick two-fingerhead that lingers. Taste is fresh cut citrus, grapefruit, orange peel and pith, pine and resin. Feel is light - so crisp and incredibly drinkable. The bottle drained way too quickly, whether because of its supreme drinkability or my excitement I don't know. But it fucking vanished.  I can see why this beer is considered a true classic that has stood at or near the top of the pile of contenders. If I had access to it regularly it would be a fridge mainstay. Drinks crisp and clean with a lightness that belies the IPA-standard ABV. Must taste unreal out of a fresh keg. Is it a perfect beer? I have no idea but it's undoubtedly special.\n",

Malty... more so than expected. Caramel and toasted grains. Solid bitterness... hop profile was pine, herbal, and mild citrus. A little bit of pepper. Medium to light in body.

Whatever, this beer is okay, nothing special, SNPA kicks the shit out of this beer and in my opinion that beer has held it's own with the changing of the times, however, this beer is a different story...ehhh.\n",

Rich amber color with slightly off-white head and big head. Surprisingly rich color. Nose a rather typical pale ale hoppy nose with fruity hops dominant, but not excessively fruity. Deliciously balanced pale ale taste - not hugely inventive, but balanced, pleasant, with no false notes. Hops forward, dry malt flavor carries the middle flavor, dry finish, typical slightly bitter finish and aftertaste. This would be a good intro pale ale for someone who wanted to know \"what pale ales are all about,\" especially in regards to a basic American style pale ale. Though of course they should probably try a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, too.\n",

      "Gifted by a friend - first beer I've had from these guys. No date found but likely two months old. Pours a surprising amber color for a pale ale. thin white head that laces well on the glass. Smell is mostly sweet malt with a hint of citrus peeking through. If \"aggressive\" citrus was a goal of the hopping it doesn't really come through in the aroma. Taste is similar to the smell in that it is malt forward with a nice solid base of caramel malts with a layering of citrus hops on top that come through closer to the finish. There is a lingering bitterness in the finish that works well to counteract the sweetness up front. Feel is slightly sticky as this is a medium bodied beer with all the malt., but otherwise it has a clean finish. There is a slight alcohol burn in the finish - I guess due to the unusually high ABV of 6.66% for a pale ale. This is like a pale ale that wishes it was a strong ale. Flavors are clean and well balanced and I can see how they want to make this a flagship beer. My personal taste is for less malt, especially in the a APA so this is not one I would reach for again. That does not take away from a grade as an excellent beer though.\n",

      "From a 32 oz growler (growlette?) purchased at the Nova, into an Spieglau IPA glass...because there's no way that this isn't an IPA. Pours a clear deep rusty carmel amber, with 1 finger of off-white head and good retention. On the nose, this actually reminds me of a lot of a number of oldish school ipas from the PNW: caramel (almost candied carmel) and biscuity malts with some resinous pine, candied grapefruit peel, and just a little faint spice. The taste carries the nose forward, providing a little more of the spicy and earthy hoppiness, especially at the end. It is very well constructed and everything fits together great. For all the serious flavor and hoppy heft, this one is also quite smooth. Even though there is a great deal of bitterness that always feels right around the corner, it never really bites...in fact, with the biscuity malts, there's also something kind of like honey in there that really mellows it out in places, while at the same time balancing that with some spicy and green herbal notes. Though it is fairly substantial in feel, it isn't too heavy or boozy. A little sticky sweet in the middle, but dries out decently by the end, and finishes clean.  Always nice to find this one, even if I have to cross a state line or two...can't believe I haven't rated it before. The more I think about it, the more this one kind of reminds me of a Boneyard beer, which is probably the last really nice, really memorable beer-in-style I've had. Now that would be a fun side-by-side.\n",

Lots of citrus in the smell- orange, grapefruit, lemon, hint of lime, pine, some yeast, malt, a light dankness. The taste also starts with big citrus- orange, grapefruit, lime, lemon, malt, pine- especially on the finish. A good amount of hop bitterness up front, the malt tames it thereafter. A light sweetness overall. Smooth, a solid medium body, well carbonated.  Very good citrus aroma and flavor. Well balanced between the hops and malt, really feels more like a DIPA.

      "Pours a hazy, amber color topped by an inch of coarse, white suds. Wonderfully tropical aroma evokes lemon, mango, and grapefruit. Bountiful lees can be seen both in suspension and on the floor of the glass. The taste is founded on a deft balance of lemongrass, lemon, pepper, and biscuity, crackery malt. The synergy between malt and hops, both of which are tastefully understated, is quite excellent--a cohesive whole more so than the sum of its parts. Medium body and delicate carbonation produce a smooth, velvety mouthfeel that's reinforced by a mildly chalky yeast character. A dry finish leaves you ready to dive back in for more. Overall, this is a fantastically well-balanced and refreshing APA. While not especially complex, it is well integrated and has no off flavors to speak of. With its delicate, refreshing flavor profile, herbal bitterness, and luscious mouthfeel, it almost evokes an American interpretation of a saison. This could very well be the best APA I've had.\n",

Mango, pine, mint, and grapefruit. Hint of dry cracker malt backbone in the background. M: Light-medium body. Fruit sweetness with fairly restrained bitterness. Nice lingering on the palate.

      "Daisy Cutter looks the part, and I appreciate that. It has a golden body kissed by amber. It's not entirely clear, but it's beautiful nonetheless, especially donning that foamy white cap that leaves traces everywhere it touches. That's a proper pale ale smell right there. Grapefruit plays support to a healthy dose of biscuity and ever so slightly caramelized malts, but stepping aside in respect for a wonderful damp pine (paging @cjgiant ). Something else lies deep beneath. Like a glazed melon I can't quite figure out. Yes. This here is what I am looking for in a pale ale. A great balance of sweet, savory, spicy, and bitter. Umami for a pale ale so to speak. A flash of bread is quickly met by toasted sesame. Layers of citrus fruits come in at the middle before a piney, citric, and peppery hop finish lingers on.  I try to savor each sip, but it's remarkably drinkable. Again, this has everything you'd need in a great pale ale. A semi sweet start, a nice medium body, a crisp and bubbly finish, and an appropriate bittered end. Daisy Cutter is my kind of Pale Ale. I would gladly purchase and consume this on a regular basis if available to me. It's old school, bold, and what you'd expect in all the best of ways. Another one of those beers that makes me question, \"Why do I keep bothering with all the rest?\" Well, I always will, but with beers like this, there really isn't much need to. Cheers.\n",

Feel: light on the palate, medium bodied, and with a slightly off-dry finish. Overall: pretty tasty pale ale, especially for the price.\n",

Carbonation is plentiful and small bubbles. Mild lacing down the glass. AROMA: I've let this warm up a few minutes, and am getting a nice dose of orange, sugar topped grapefruit, and a touch of pine. Sweet caramel malt as well. The aroma, in general, isn't overpowering, but everything is there. TASTE: Super balanced. Nice caramel malt sweetness, then citrus, minor pine, and the bitterness hits on the finish. FEEL: Nice full carbonation on the tongue, but an easy drinking, smooth beer.

Medium-heavy body; soft prickliness to the palate with some overall dry notes; low-key warmth. My bottle sample was packaged 5/7/19, so damn good freshness especially since this was found in Colorado Springs.

      "BOTTLE: Bottled 10/11/16 (making this 19 days old at the time of the review). Batch 180. 1 pint .9 fl oz. Iconic simple white label. Silver branded pry-off crown cap. Brown glass. 6.00% ABV. \"Pale ale.\" Served cold into a nonic pint glass. I'm hugely excited for this since I've really liked some of Maine Beer Company's beers and this is currently #9 on the Top 100 Maine (state) list. HEAD: Soft fluffy head. Off-white colour. Frothy and robust. Has a nice consistency and complexion. ~8 minute retention. Leaves a bit of lacing as it recedes, but not much. BODY: Murky dull yellow-orange. Appears unfiltered. Hazy and nontransparent, but translucent. Appears well-carbonated. Far from unique or special for a pale ale, but generally appealing. I'm optimistic. AROMA: One of the freshest hop aromas I've encountered this year (even beating out fresh hop pale ales like Lagunitas' rather good Born Yesterday Pale Ale). Vivid floral notes, expressive tropical fruit (mainly tangerine, and luckily no boozy pineapple), bursts of subtle blueberry/bilberry, pleasant hop oils, and onion. It's hard to believe they accomplished all this with only Falconer's Flight and Simcoe; before I checked Maine's site to see which hops were used I might have bet that Mosaic was involved - but then I guess I've been too bombarded lately with all these hipster hop beers. It's great to see a brewery mastering the pale ale with tried and true classic hops. That, or maybe they did source some newer hops for this batch? What do I know. The level of pale malt sweetness is perfect for balancing out the hop bitterness based on the aroma. This aroma suggests a soft brew; maybe that red wheat malt is helping impart that aromatically. Aromatic intensity is above average for a pale ale, with pungent notes of fresh oily hops punching through the malts to really entice. I can't wait for the first sip. TASTE &amp; TEXTURE: The wheat does give it a bit more softness in feel than I'm used to in pale ales, and coupled with the perfect level of carbonation that makes this particularly pleasant and approachable. Aptly medium-bodied, smooth, wet, and refreshing, with a slightly oily feel accentuating the hop flavours wonderfully. And there are plenty of hop flavours in the build: vivid floral hop notes, oily hops nodding towards a slightly resinous taste, subtle Simcoe-derived onion, and subsidiary hints of fruit (mainly blueberry and a bit of tangerine). It isn't the \"zesty citrus, passion fruit and pine\" hop profile advertised on Maine Beer Company's website, but it's right on the money for a pale ale and all the hop bitterness is cleverly disguised by a perfect amount of balancing pale malt sweetness. As it warms a bit, I get a blip of lime and some fresh wheat. Good depth of flavour. Above average flavour duration. Average flavour intensity. I love that it puts balance ahead of palate-assaulting bitterness; that's increasingly rare nowadays. OVERALL: A beautifully balanced, incredibly drinkable pale ale from one of the Northeast's finest breweries, MO is a treat of a beer that will please even the most nitpicky of drinkers. I already want another, but at $9.00 a pop in NYC, I doubt I'll be enjoying this often. Were it offered in 6 packs for $10-16, it'd definitely be a regular rotator in my fridge. Possibly the best pale ale I've tried this year, and easily up there with stye paragons like Alpine's underrated Alpine Ale or Russian River's Happy Hops in my book. A must-try for the discerning drinker and casual drinker alike. B (3.68) / GOOD\n",

      "It's interesting to see some comparisons to this being a lower-grade option for Heady. I wouldn't quite call it that, but I will say that when MBC sets out to make a beer, they make a solid, well-rounded beer. Delightful and imminently drinkable every step of the way. The beer fits its own description every step of the way. The body has a nice head and a clear, crisp texture. The smell is of light, sweet fruit - pineapple, mango, apricot, and passionfruit - with a mellow but firm piney bitterness. The taste is certainly on the dry side, especially in the finish, but there is a good balance here which tempers the bitter hops, injects a light, malty feeling of restraint, and makes this an easy beer to put down. Seems lighter than it is, and is certainly worthy of your time, though I'm always slightly disappointed when a beer is so much more dry and less flavorful than its aroma suggests.\n",

      "Serving: Bottle into pint Served: 18 Jul 2014 Appearance: Pours with a nice orange-ish amber color with a nice two finger cream colored head. Head dissipates slowly into a slight sheen of bubbles across the top of the beer which facilitate mild lacing on the side of the glass. Slight carbonation slowly rising from the bottom of the glass really makes this one a sight. Smell: Sweeter malts overlayed with a mild assertion of floral and citrus hops. The hops in the nose do not overpower you but add a nice soft roundness, which is exactly what I'm looking for in an APA. Taste: Crisp and smooth beer with a solid malt backbone and great levels of floral and citrus hops. The side of the bottle says cascades are used in this, and you can definitely tell- the hop profile is extremely similar to an SNPA, however, I will say that SNPA is considerably maltier and more bitter than Burning River. Sweet malts start coming out as the beer warms up, though this compliments the medium hoppiness. Finishes semi-sweet. Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation and solid body. Overall: A very serviceable APA that should be admired by most beer drinkers, craft lovers and those new to craft alike. The hopping levels are perfect for an APA, leaving a nice lighter beer with considerable flavor and body without being cumbersome or abrasive. Would recommend, especially as a cookout beer.\n",

      "12 fl oz brown glass bottle with fun label art and branded silver pry-off pressure cap acquired at Zipp's Liquor in Minneapolis, MN for $1.79 and served into a weissbier glass. Expectations are high given the brewery. Reviewed live. \"A handcrafted pale ale.\" 6.0% ABV confirmed. Enjoy by: 11/13/13. Reviewed as a pale Served cold - straight from the fridge. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated. A: No bubble show forms as it's poured.  Pours a four finger wide head of white colour and nice even consistency. Decent thickness, creaminess and frothiness. Retention is good - about 5-6 minutes. Even lacing coats the sides of the glass as the head recedes.  Body colour is a clear translucent copper of average vibrance. No yeast particles are visible.  Overall, it's an appealing appearance and I'm eager to try it, but it's not unique or special. No egregious flaws.  Sm: Clean. Floral hops. Pale malts. Vague fruity hop character. No yeast character or alcohol is detectable. A pleasant aroma of average strength.  T: Pale malt backbone is joined by a floral hop profile with hints of fruity hops.  Cohesive and enjoyable, but not gestalt, complex, subtle, or intricate.  Clean, without any real yeast character. No alcohol comes through.  Average depth, intensity, and duration of flavour.  Mf: Smooth, wet, well-carbonated, nicely thick, and medium-bodied. Suits the flavour profile well. Nice unobtrusive presence on the palate.  Not oily, astringent, harsh, gushed, hot, or boozy.  Dr: Drinkable, but I hoped for better from Great Lakes. It's a quaffable pale ale but offers nothing memorable. Will get lost amist the plethora of superior beers in the style. I might get it again if I'm in the mood for a pale ale, but I wouldn't recommend it to friends. Certainly not world-class, but well above average. High C+ *** 02/11/17: 2nd impressions from a bottle bought in Chicago: Heavy on the caramalt/toasted malt for a pale ale, bringing it closer almost to an amber in terms of perceived malt sweetness. Hop profile brings hints of grapefruit alongside the dominant generic floral hop character. C+ / ABOVE AVERAGE\n",

      "BOTTLE: Brown glass with a branded pry-off crown cap. Purchased for $7.99 at a beer store in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY. Brewed 09/13/16. Iconic simple white label design. 5.50% ABV. HEAD: Impressive, boasting a good 5-6 fingers worth of frothy white foam. Soft in appearance with a nice complexion. Retention is excellent - ~10+ minutes. No lacing sticks to the sides of the glass as the head recedes. BODY: Murky yellow-copper colour of average vibrance. No visible yeast, though it does appear unfiltered.  Appears well-carbonated. The head is more attractive than the body. AROMA: Marvelous, screaming hops without seeming imbalanced. One of the most pleasant floral hop aromas I've ever encountered, nodding towards classic American hops (Centennial) instead of the fancy new tropical hops all the kids think are cool these days. Floral notes, lemon zest, faint lime, and subtle grassy aromatics round out the hop profile. Soft crackery malts and pale malts lend just the right amount of sweetness. Saison-like sea salt spiciness gives it flair without distracting from the cleanly attenuating American ale yeast. Not fruity, oily, resinous, or juicy. But the floral character alone is enough to seize my interest. Aromatic intensity is average. TASTE &amp; TEXTURE: Lime zest, slight lemony twang, sea salt, dry crackery malts, pale malts. The floral hop character plays well with the subtle lime and grassiness, acknowledging the undeniable influence of cleaner pale ales like Sierra Nevada's classic offering while bending a bit towards a saison-like spiciness and Belgian influence. Texture is soft yet dry and coarse, which helps amplify depth of flavour at the expense of drinkability. Nevertheless, it's still refreshing, with a light to medium body and a pleasant overall presence on the palate. Balanced and well built, though it does lack the hop pungency you'd expect in a (contemporary) American-brewed American pale ale. OVERALL: Leave the fancy New Zealand hops to the fad breweries churning out mediocre IPAs and embrace Maine Beer Company's Peeper Ale, a classically styled pale ale with a bit of lemony twang and spice that hints towards Belgian saisons. Going unfiltered with an American pale ale is something of a risk, but Peeper will reward discerning drinkers with a more memorable lively yeast flavour than most expressions of the style. There's room for improvement in terms of intricacy of build and depth of flavour, but Peeper Ale is a drinkable brew in a style that's hard to stick out in. Were this available in $12.99ish six packs instead of the $7.99 500ml format, I imagine I'd be buying it semiregularly. High B- (3.49) / WORTHY *** Review from notes taken February 2015: Served on-draught into a nonic at Alphabet City Beer Co, New York, NY. 5.5% ABV. HEAD: Pours a half finger orth of white head, receding quickly within 20 seconds, leaving no lacing on the sides of the nonic. Appears thin. BODY: Clear yellow with honey hues. Average in terms of vibrance. Clean, lacking an visible yeast or sediment. Generally appealing. Not unique or special for the style. AROMA: Pale malts, fresh floral hop aromatics, some tropical fruit (mainly mango and tangerine). Clean and fragrant. Hop-forward but balanced.  No overt yeast, alcohol, or off-notes re detectable. Mild intensity of flavour. TASTE: Pale malts balance the bitterness of the hops. Hop character is nicely floral, fresh, and fruity, with new world hop flavours of mango, tangerine, and bursts of citrus. It's a pleasant marraige of malts and hops but lacks the complexity, intricacy, and depth of superior beers in the style. Boasts interesting subtlety especially where the fruity hop flavours are concerned. Average flavour duration and flavour intensity. Not a gestalt build overall, but a cohesive one. TEXTURE: Smooth, wet, crisp, light to medium-bodied, refreshing, and approachable, with a nice overall presence on the palate.  Texture complements the taste generally well but doesn't elevate the beer as a whole or accentuate specific notes effectively. Not oily, gushed, hot, boozy, astringent, harsh, rough, or scratchy. OVERALL: Highly drinkable but not world class. It's good work from a great brewery and I'd happily get it again, but it's not up there with the best expressions of the style. Well worth trying, though, and I'll enjoy finishing the glass. High B- / WORTHY\n",

      "Another bottle from my recent haul from their taproom, Peeper was not a beer I'd heard of before. I suppose it's worth mentioning that I only visited the brewery on a tip from a bartender in Portland-- I'd never heard of it before, so I had no expectations; this is a hype-free review. Appearance is yellow and a little cloudy. Smell is not quite piney, but there's something earthy about it that I can't put my finger on, I want to say grass and leaves. I do like the smell. Taste has some grass to it. It also has lots of grapefruit, which I was neither expecting nor hoping for. It's much fruitier than I'd thought it'd be, especially from the smell. Mouthfeel is lightish, and smooth. Overall: Maybe it's because I've been away from New England for so long, but I expected the fruit dialed down slightly, and a little more of the grassy flavor. That said, I do like it, it's a refreshing beer to drink in this warm weather, but I just don't like it as much as everybody else seems to.\n",

Easy five minutes before it has settled enough to drink. Heavy lacing to boot. S: Oh yeah. Fresh, pungent and juicy. Lots of citrus - oranges specifically. Very light pine. A pleasure just to smell it. T: Lots of floral hops up front with plenty of citrus backing. Spicy pine kicks in in the middle. The hop flavors don't so much as meld together as they have distinct starting and ending points. Very interesting. And delicious. Light grainy malt helps sweeten it up just enough. Mild wave of bitterness and then a crisp finish with lingering floral hops primarily. Very little aftertaste, just sort of a lingering grainy bitterness.  M: Surprisingly heavy bodied for 5.2%. I assume the unfiltered nature has given it a little more heft? Hard to say, it is shockingly heavy and silky smooth to boot. A little lower carbonation helps the mouthfeel too I think. O: One hell of an APA. I've had most of the top 10 APAs on this site (currently anyway) and this one is right up there. It might just be the best of them. The mouthfeel especially is a notch above, so full and smooth it really makes this incredibly drinkable - further enhancing the APA character. Ridiculously good, on a level that I didn't even realize was possibly. Having said all of that, how could I give it anything but a 5 here?\n",

Big herbal fruity hop flavor; how did they pack all that in an Pale Ale? A strong bitter pop, especially late.

      "Upfront disclosure: this has been my favorite brewery for about a dozen years. I flatter myself that that award is worth something. But, even if that award is not worth much... this ale is. For those who are tired of paying money to have their buds assaulted by too many hops by too many brewers who are still learning to blend malts, then this is the beer for you. 6/12/16 re-rate: Decreased Smell by .25 and increased Taste as Moon Man went well with guacamole. Bumped-up the Overall .25 because I really do like the progressive Heartland mindset of this beer: nothing extreme, just be. 8/15/17 Moon Man clearly has become a regular of mine as long as I live in Chicago and can jump the border. Had Moon Man this time as 1/2 session and 1/2 to accompany Indian leftovers. I enjoyed my Moon Man lunch very much ! 8/18/18 It is summer and it is time for Moon Man. Because it is malted well and its hops are subtle, it pairs well with most summer foods, especially if they get grilled. 8/19/19 Getting to see a pattern here? An obvious annual ritual as I go to Wisconsin in the summer and grab New Glarus' sampler. This APA is as steady as hops get for a malt-head like me.

I held it up to the light and it had glorious sunset orange hues with a solid gold core. It left thin lacing on the glass. Smell: At first caramely and biscuity but then comes a rush of floral, grassy, and peppery hues from the hops which include the high-alpha classic Galena.  Taste: Bitter right upfront with grapefruit rind, lemon, white pepper, and herbs leading to a subtle malty swell of toasted biscuits and honey. There is a peculiar buttery quality throughout. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, slightly crisp, and moist upfront. The finish is oily with a lingering bitterness but it is dry on the back of the palate.  Overall: Delicious, complex, satisfying, rich, and well brewed. It has the robust character of a full blown IPA but the crisp drinkability and quaffable characteristics of a Pale Ale.

Not even the littlest hint of any hops at all up front; small amount at the end. Was hoping for more from this, especially based on the ratings.

Moderately low bitterness, even lower once it warms. I can't be for sure as I've never had this beer before but I think it's probably an outdated bottle.

      "so the american mild ale is a new concept. is that basically a more malt driven session beer? logically i would say so, but this isnt that. its hoppy as heck, more of an american pale than anything else, so a little weird to tackle conceptually, although especially easy to drink down. clear in looks, but rather copper or amber or brass colored for a pale mild ale. its not english in any way, and even though they make the distinction, its sort of weird to think about what a mild ale is outside of that context. bright hoppiness, not dissimilar to other beers that these guys make. its bitter and clean too, malty, but light, a bunch of fun contradictions, but at the end of the day, this is average by three floyds standards, and not way off from a light american pale ale with decent balance. cool beer, a slugger from the bottle, but not where some of the others are i dont think in terms of being one of a kind.\n",

      "Thanks to Irishace9 for this one. Had once before on tap, this is my first bottle experience with this one. Poured from 12 oz. bottle into CCB pint glass. A: This is an attractive, nice copper with some haze. Fluffy two-finger off-white head that lasts. Medium level of visible carbonation. S: Hops (pine with a touch of citrus) and bready, chewy malt. Not a big aroma overall here - although the amount of aroma and the citrus rind aspect grows as the beer warms during the drink. T: Follows aroma - with the addition of grassiness to the hop profile, and an almost wheat/grainy flavor on the exhale. Overall impression is a bit malt forward. Dry with a moderate bitterness on the finish. M: Heavy-bodied for style, and chewy. Good carbonation sensation. No alcohol to speak of. O: An enjoyable beer. I think it could be just a bit more hoppy (especially the citrus character), but this seems to be a personal preference. The wheat flavor seems a bit out of place, but I think it's growing on me. Tasty, but nothing that blows your socks off.\n",

      "Living in Chicago I am lucky to have access to Three Floyd's lineup on a first-come-first-serve basis. It's not that hard to find 3F beers in chicago...it's just that if you aren't buying it from the brewery then you usually have a limited selection. This is one of the ones that usually gets neglected when people snap up 3F at the stores. For example I heard someone at Binny's last week ask a worker if they have any 3F in stock. The worker replied: \"Well, we have a few six packs of Pride &amp; Joy\" To which the costumer said: \"Awwww dammit, that sucks.\" I've overlooked this beer, as I think many people have in our area. The beer itself isn't spectacular. Right one the bottle it says \"Mild Ale\"...and yes it is mild for 3F standards. Nothing stands out. But I can see why they make it. Perfect for hipsters who want to drink 3F, but can't stand hops. With a lower ABV it is certainly sessionable, but at the $11.99 per sixer price (plus Chicago taxes) I don't see it being worth it for the price as a session beer. Now if it were $7.99 per sixer I'd be much more pleased.  My preference of Pale Ales (NOTE: I prefer the Hoppier-styled APAs) Zombie Dust&amp;gt;Alpha King&amp;gt; ---(Then a gap)---Daisy Cutter&amp;gt;Sierra Nevada&amp;gt;Pride&amp;Joy All in all, I'd pass on it.

Smell: Smells mildly sweet, certainly yeasty with a hint of toasted malts and subtle bittery hops. Otherwise it does not smell especially notable. Taste: Now this is one tasty beer! First few sips were nice and biting. I could taste the malty characteristics right away, along with the hoppy character that I noted prior in smelling. The latter flavor lingers somewhat, but it is not unpleasant in the slightest. It tastes quite good after a few more sips are had. It's not especially bitter, but just enough to remind you that it's a pale ale. A good one at that. Mouthfeel: About average. Does not feel watery or thick. You could certainly chug this one if you really wanted to on an especially hot day and not feel at all weighed down by it. Mild carbonation, not at all flat.  Overall: A fantastic brew and my first one out of this brewery. Maybe I have a soft spot for pale ales, but this one is a winner in my books.

Suggestions of honey. There's a good quantity of grapefruit here, but it's sadly overshadowed by resins and pine.  Feel is crisp and clean, leaves a slightly oily residue on the tongue and mouth.  Overall, I'd place this somewhere between Alpha King and Zombie Dust. It's decent, especially the nose, but the fruit is lost in a haze of pine and resins and it comes off way more bitter than it is.

Plenty aromatic, all the usual descriptors, citrus, tropical, pine, green, lush.  Taste, nice light bodied, relatively dry pale toasted malt backbone, ample juicy hops with tempered bitterness. Basically this is elite level pale ale stuff. Carbonation on point. Quaffable and easy to do so. Caramel malt aspect is minimal. Really the only downside to this beer is its bomber format. Put it in a 6 pack and charge $2-$2.50 a 12oz bottle and I'm upping my score.\n",

      "On tap into a pint glass A - Beer arrived at the table with a tall frothy white head that is retained for what seems like forever. Beer is clear and copper in color with very low carbonation visible. 4/5 S - Grapefruit and pine resin hit me full force immediately on the nose. This is very quickly followed by a light caramelized white bread as well as orange peel. Not overly complicated but still rather enjoyable. 4/5 T - Grapefruit and piney hops form the base flavor profile of this beer, especially on the front end. Orange peel is discerned immediately following the grapefruit which leads to a light cereal malt and a sweet caramel. Simple and sessionable. A bit tart throughout. 3.75/5 M - Moderate carbonation burn and very drying from beginning to end. Definitely a hop centric beer. Light and crisp. 4.25/5 O - Hop centric beer from beginning to end with a nice complexity of hop flavors. The malt plays a balancing act, attempting to slightly reign in the hops so that the bitterness is not overwhelming. Very enjoyable session pale ale that is excellent with food. Not crazy bitter and definitely not sweet. 4/5\n",

      "A hazy orange, gold. Very nice fluffy, off-white, mustache leaving head that expectedly leaves a lot of lacing.  Surprisingly, it smells very malty. Tons of biscuity/cracker aromas with some citrus in the form of orange.  Tastes really how I expected. Orange rind is ripe and slightly sour, combined with sweet biscuity, almost wheat like malts. Very juicy. The hop notes are really subdued, especially for a 3F brew, but it is much greener cold, and the bitterness shows up in the end and lingers through the aftertaste along with some herbal/ floral hops. It really, really lingers. Kind of sneaks up on you.  I find the body to be pretty full for the ABV. Very smooth and a nice amount of resin slickness. I can see some people finding it a little heavy, but I can't imagine doing much better here.  There are not too many sub 6% beers that I have been excited about. This is outstanding though. I rated it as a straight up pale ale, but if there were a \"session ale\" category, it would score higher. Along with Carton Boat, and Fat Heads Sunshine Daydream, it is one of the best.\n",

Smell: Grapefruit and tropical flavors - smells sticky sweet and hoppy dry at the same time. I have usually associated this aroma with Lagunitas, but I have noticed it with multiple 3 Floyds beers as well. Taste: Slightly more restrained than the aroma suggested, but very well balanced and tasty. The grapefruit and tropical hops are prominent with some almost wheat-like malts. Not as sticky sweet as expected, and the bitterness is in check as well. Feel: Moderate carbonation, medium body. Very dry, borderline tart, finish. Overall: 3 Floyds calls this a Session beer, which is of course ridiculous.

      "Canned on: 12/8/17. Opened on 12/9/17 Update review ** canned on 7/9/18. Orange tinted gold coloration, muddy body, opaque depth, with a puffy white cloud of foam recedes slow. A bit of scattered coverage is left over with nice lace. The nose is very powerful. Pungent citrus , wild honey pie, starfruit and herbs with a fruity, tropical blend and black pepper from the rather excellent Galaxy hop strain. Tangerine, pineapple and sweet red fruits all blend together harmoniously.  This is easily the most, tropical and citrus fruity hop flavor from a Pale Ale I've ever had. New England style...but not an IPA. just pale. It's like a pale ale, blended with tropical punch and o.j. mix in some earthy herbs and husky wheat finished off with black pepper. A nice citrus bite brings in a juicy feel, thick body and a slightly dry, earthy toned finish. Rather extreme in it's hoppy complexity and off the charts juicy style. The light wheat and golden style malt allows for maximum hop effect but still has some fine flavor's as well. ** the clean feel and APA style flavor approach from such a thick looking body is pretty amazing. It's reasonable to say this is the most complex hoppy flavor from any straight pale ale I can think of.  Galaxy is a very versatile hop, one of my all time favorites, although My specialty is the old world, European strain, Galaxy seems to bring in huge fruitiness but with plenty of old earthy tones as well. At 6.6 % abv, massive hoppiness this could easily be mistaken for an IPA. The body is thick, smooth but juicy.llI think of pale ale's to have a cleaner malty body. The hops totally dominates although tge malt is nice...lfor an IPA! Regardless, this is \"what's hot\" in the beer (geek) world right nowl New England styles. Don't get me wrong, the hop complexity is mindblowing, but the balance for a Pale Ale is questionable.  Overall, high quality. Dense complexity in the hop, easy to drink, relentless hoppy flavor. The malt is also very tasty and unique just a bit off kilter in balance for tge style. But who reviews or rates a beer just on style guidlines these days, anyway??\n",

      "Trillium Galaxy Dry-Hopped Fort Point A: This Trillium skates dangerously close to the pond water opacity that is Tree House, staying just on this side of murky. It is full of particulate reminiscent of its forefather Heady Topper. These particles are tossed about by the rather active carbonation, which also contributes to an impressive retention and a settling into thick, dense crust of the once two-finger cream-colored head. Lacing is also very good. As with most of these DDH beers, some will find the yeast and hop matter off-putting, but it is an otherwise brilliant example of the NE IPA substyle. 4.75/5 A: Strong peach and apricot notes dominate a juicy cuvée of grapefruit and orange juice. A resinous dankness lurks underneath, as expected of the sometimes heavily bitter Galaxy hop. Interesting notes of papaya and passionfruit lie partially hidden underneath the earthy grass and pine. Finally, a crackery malt serves as the canvas for the entire beer. This seems exceedingly well-balanced and reined in, despite the sometimes overbearing Galaxy. 4.5/5 T: Unfortunately, Galaxy refused to be tamed in the taste. Bitter grass, resinous pine, earthy dankness, and bitter grapefruit pith dominate the tongue initially and hardly let up. It is possible to pick out some juicy peach, melon, and passion fruit underneath the rampaging Galaxy (especially in the aftertaste), but overall this is heavily dominated by earthy, almost spicy bitterness. Orange juice comes out more each sip, but bitter citrus rind also builds in much the same way. Lemon and lightly bitter floral notes are present in the aftertaste as well. The malt is very dry and crackery, lending only a slight kiss of sweetness that is all but drowned out by the hops. As with many DDH beers, this one is too hoppy for its own good, covering up some of the great complexity, but it is still very tasty. 4.25/5 M: Again, the hops are just too much here. The bitterness puts a toe into unpleasant territory becoming almost medicinally astringent and chalky. The beer is very dry, yet the feel is typically medium full and creamy, astonishingly so for a pale ale. Carbonation is prickly yet soft, right where it should be. The sharp bitterness on the end just proves too much for the rest of the beer, and paradoxically a stickiness is left on the lips. 4/5 O: I know that I am in the minority with finding the DDH iterations of these beers less palatable than their regular counterparts, but the hoppiness is just too much sometimes. The well-crafted balance of the \"normal\" versions displays all the complexity with better drinkability in a more enjoyable package. High end hop heads and west-coast fans will definitely prefer the DDH beers, but give me the good, old-fashioned juicy NE IPA any day. Pair with Cattle Decapitation's \"The Anthropocene Extinction,\" which was also grand in its own way at the expense of much of the nuance and personality that made \"Monolith of Inhumanity\" so compelling. 4/5\n",

Nose is very sweet: tropical, with an emphasis on the mango, plus rock sugar.  Fort Point - Galaxy Dry Hopped &amp; my flash-impression is ‘watery’. Very thin. Flavor is good, with lots of tropical notes, especially mango, oranges, grapefruit, lime, damp grass. Widespread bitterness mid-palate; pith of the grapefruit is what hangs around. Easy to slug.

      "if you are into the big juicy milky thick east coast hoppy beers, they dont get a whole lot better than this one. thanks to my home for sharing this (and a number of other trillium beers) with me! this is an amazing expression of galaxy, but not having had the original beer, its tough to measure the difference, or just how much more vibrant the hops might be. i suspect its a lot, at least on the aroma side, where notes of honeysuckle, lime, and pot resin hit my nose beautifully, thats galaxy alright. its not a yeasty beer despite the look, i suspect its mostly hop haze, maybe a little bit of wheat malt in here too contributes to that, i certainly get that kind of body here. the hops are juicy and fresh, as boldy dosed as can be, but there is literally hardly any bitterness at all to this, it finishes somewhat dry, but not harsh at all. smooth and fuller bodied for an american pale, the hops make this totally unique, and even though a lot of these cloudy trillium hoppy beers have some similar features, this one really stands out to me from the rest of them. i need to try the original fort point, but this galaxy edition is special.\n",

      "First beer I've tried from Trillium. Bottle dated June 10 and poured on June 20 into a 16 oz tulip. Purchased at the brewery in Canton. Looks spot on for a cloudy APA. Golden orange with a decent finger of foam. Smell is just not present, kinda disappointing, I expected more. Taste made up for the lack of aroma. I picked up grapefruit, mango and stone fruit with a refreshing finish of mild malt. Feels thinner that what I expected, but still thick enough and good carbonation. Overall, at $8.05 per bottle it's competitive with Treehouse and I'm thinking I might get hooked. Especially since they don't ration it out like it's the prohibition era. Editing and revising my rating upward after trying a second bottle that spent a couple more weeks in the fridge. This is an outstanding APA.\n",

Rounds out with some slightly sour bitter (dry?) hops. Orange juice. Pineapple.  T - sweet candied orange juice with a huge sticky breadiness that almost expands outward as you sip. Creates a layer of Galaxy goodness that sort of hovers above the rest of the beer. The dry hopping creates a flavor effect like Saturn's rings, whatever that means. Pineapple of course and a surprisingly mild bitterness. Galaxy hop blanket soothes and comforts. Nice, balanced flavor.  F - soft and flowing as usual. Works especially well with this dry hop.

      "Poured from a single serve into a tulip Pours nearly clear--just a bit of haze--medium gold with a nice two-fingered foamy head. Fairly good lacing throughout.  Citrus aromas very forward--lemon, red grapefruit, white grapefruit. Clean pale malt sweetness is there too, with some piney and mineral notes.  The initial taste on the tip of the tongue is citrus--lemon mostly--with bready malt and some esters close behind. Piney and dank hops and mineral notes arrive at the middle of the quaff, with solid grassy, earthy, and floral notes at the finish. The nearly 8% ABV is barely noticeable, mostly as the brew warms. In fact, the brew almost \"phase shifts\" from APA at cool temperature to IPA at higher temp as the earthy floral hops open up at the warmer temperature. The feel of this brew is pretty special. Medium-light to medium bodied, it has excellent, but not overbearing carbonation. The finish isn't \"crisp\" but it arrives with a nice drying note. The booze is well-restrained. Like many, I'm guilty of paying insufficient attention to the APA style. This is a tasty take that pulls some IPA flavors into the discussion.\n",

Pale cracker malt body. Not huge but pretty decent for an APA. T: Dank and citrus up front again, with a solid backbone of tropical fruits, lychee, and melon hops. A light biscuity sweetness from the malts, but they mostly stay out of the way. It finishes with a fairly significant bitterness (especially for an APA), with more dank and grapefruit rind. M: A light body, and carbonation sensation is a touch on the low side. Low alcohol overall, but maybe a bit pronounced for style. O: I really enjoyed this one. It's nothing crazy or complex.

      "12 oz. bottle - looks like it was bottled at the end of December? Be great if Lagunitas could use standard bottle dating, but i digress. Acquired the twelve pack of this stuff from the local beer store. \"Ale brewed with natural blood orange juice\". The bottle here lists a 7.70% abv. Poured into a Central Waters snifter. A - Pours a juicy golden pale ale body, lightly hazy, with a good finger's worth of frothy soapy white head that lingers, leaving some good scattered spotty lacing behind. S - Huuuuuge citrus blast hits the sense upon uncapping. This thing literally smells like i just cut into an orange. Mouth-watering fruits on this one. Beneath the citrus, there is some dry bready malts and ale yeast present T - Taste follows the nose: huge blast of citrus and orange juice - this thing literally tastes like half a glass of fresh-squeeze juice was dumped into this. Lots of acidity; lightly tart. Complements the beautifully fresh piney hop presence extremely well. Fresh hops, fresh malts, fresh juiciness. This thing is just all around great. M - Feel is smooth, juicy, crisp, clean. Borderline refreshing, especially at 7.70% abv. This would make an excellent summer slammer. Overall, one of the juiciest and most delicious beers I think I've ever had from Lagunitas ever, which is now over 30 different Lagunitas beers for me.

      "Cigar City Invasion A: In line with flagship Jai Alai, Invasion pours with very good clarity. It is slightly lighter in color, more of a golden orange than the brassier tones of the former, implying a lighter malt bill, most likely. Head does not get out of control, but it is a respectable two fingers, and it sticks around forever. Lacing is excellent, too. This is a great-looking pale ale. 4.75/5 A: Like its bigger brother, this succeeds at delivering on the tropical advertisement. Ruby grapefruit, mango, orange, tangerine, clementine, and a whiff of papaya make for a great fruit medley. Rindy and lightly dank bitterness balances out the candied fruit sweetness, which also has hints of caramel. Everything is a bit quiet, though, and nothing about this really stands out. Mosaic is really not obvious either, which is a problem since it is advertised on the can. There are no outright flaws here, though. 3.5/5 T: Mosaic comes through more in the flavor with some classic candied pineapple, papaya, and a little strawberry and blueberry, to the betterment of the beer. Many of the same fruits from the nose, especially grapefruit and clementine, follow through here. Spicy and floral bitterness cut the moderately juicy sweetness completely, leaving a nice biscuity, bready and mostly dry finish; this surprising malt complexity is the highlight This is a nicely flavorful pale ale for only 5%, and the malt sets this apart. 4.25/5 M: This is a delight to drink with a moderately full mouthfeel way beyond its lower ABV, perfectly medium-soft carbonation, and near-perfect level of bitterness and dryness, which leaves the barest trace of sweetness behind. This is perfect. 5/5 O: Though this stands in the shadow of Jai Also, the drier finish on Invasion actually appeals to me more. The nice maltiness is a great touch, and the overall balance is really wonderful. It is not treading in totally uncharted territory, but it is a really nice beer.

Quite outstanding nose, especially for a pale ale, that is fruit based. A mixture of classic citrus and tropical aromas present in a blended fashion with just the slightest hint of spicy spruce. The base is subtly sweet. Orange is the strongest component with pineapple, tangerine, papaya more so than mango and a faint touch of stone fruit.  Heavy light body with a texture that is slightly oily. The carbonation / body balance is very good. Effervescence is moderate but prickles the tongue just enough to help flavor separation.  The flavor profile is very good but doesn't live up to the promise of the nose. The flavors remain mostly blended with only the light spiciness of the spruce clearly separating from the nicely flavored pack. Bitterness is mild but normal for the style.

It's funny because I really, really enjoy the base beer - Fort Point - and had badly wanted DDH Fort Point for some time... but when I planned my trip to Boston, I didn't think about that one particular beer at all. I'd hoped that Tree House might have a special release or something, but didn't give Trillium a second though. Lo and behold, I ended up getting bottles and cans of several Permutations - and finally had the joy of DDH Fort Point on tap. The beer pours beautiful, a nice yellow-gold with a clean white head. It smells richly of citrus. I couldn't believe how free of bitterness it was - just a bit of light dryness, and tons of juice. I've occasionally scoffed at DDH beers that just don't seem any better than the base... this is not one of those beers. DDH Fort Point was absolutely worth the wait.

      "Canned 12/13/16. Consumed 12/26/16. A: Beer comes in a light gold color with about a finger of fluffy white head comprised of bubbles of tiny to medium size. Head slowly fades to a thin porous layer with a ring of foam around the edge of the glass. Spotty lacing sticks to the glass. Medium-plus haze--not quite as turbid as some of the other Trillium DDH offerings, but damn near close. The slightest hint of transparency gives it a really nice 'glowing' vibrancy. S: Loads of orange (juice, little bit of zest), pineapple, mango, and peach. Subtler dose of some cooling (minty?) fresh hoppy thing behind that, something like fresh green herbs, but cleaner (and less earthy) than grass. T: Big pop of tropical and citrus fruits up front. Loads of pineapple, mango, peach, and zesty orange. These are very quickly accompanied by a killer herbaceousness that reminds you just how much Citra is in this beer.. It's so purely hoppy that it almost dries out the mouth, offering a fresh, clean herbal note (maybe basil, pine, and grass) with something of a minty cooling effect? Nice wheaty malt character comes through mid-taste, and the finish is a wonderful fusion of peach, pithy citrus, and green herbs. A true delight of a flavor profile, and one of the best showcases of an incredible hop. M: Really soft and pillowy on the mouth... Definitely one of the best feels of all the Trillium beers. Has that very full carbonation that is the brewery's signature on the Street and FP series, but it's not overpowering here (and works well to complement the medium-minus weight of this 6.6% \"pale ale\"). Perfect amount of bitterness is kinda like biting into the white pith of an orange. There's definitely some dryness on the finish of this too, which is very much desired for the style. O: One of Trillium's best beers. Given all the hype around their special releases, it's the core offerings that I tend to enjoy most thoroughly. Between the Street series and the Fort Point variants alone, Trillium makes some of the best hoppy beers out there with startling consistency. DDHFPPA is a superb showcase of the complexities of the Citra hop and one of my favorite Citra-hopped IPAs (come on, it's 6.6%...) out there. Comparing it to some of my other favorites that I find similar (notably, DDH Pseudosue and Julius), I wish it had it had a bit more explosiveness on the nose and maybe a bit more weight on the body (though the carbonation does a good job accounting for the lightness). But those gripes aside, it's really hard to find flaws with this beer, and I would highly recommend it to any and all lovers of Citra.\n",

New review from 2018, canned Citra-Hopped Live: Appearance: Clean amber with a heavy head of bone-white suds. Attractive web of lace. Aroma: Citrus shops, yes. Floral, fruity, and good. Taste: Bright, fruity and citrusy with a slight bitter finish. An absolute solid beer, no question.\n",

      "aside from the fact that the bartender cant put a head on this beer to save her life, i really like this one. its golden and a little hazy, but still light enough looking in the glass. what makes it special is its hop profile. definitely new zealand varietals in here, high alpha and high oil, fruity and tropical and almost smells like a lotion some young hottie should wear, its that intense aromatically. the flavor shows the hops just like the nose, less perfume and more grassy summery feel to it, which is welcomed. the malt bill appears to contain some wheat, and has that sort of texture, which helps the hops last just a little longer. its only a little bitter too, more tangerine than anything else in the finish, which lasts awhile. overall a really really good pale ale, maybe a touch more body than it needs, but i like it this time of year, where the feel suits the season but the flavor teases summer, hard to do that well. this is top notch flavor-wise.\n",

      "Poured into a pint glass. The beer is clear with a light golden color and a thick two finger head. The aroma light with a notes of citrus and piney hops. It has a relatively light malt backbone with a pleasantly assertive hop presence (citrus/piney aroma and flavor with a good level of bitterness). The mouthfeel is good, and compliments the clean piney flavor nicely. This beer is not the strongest, hoppiest, etc., but it is just a nice solid beer, especially as the weather warms up. Having one of these beers after a nice day outside in the sun can really hit the spot.\n",

      "My first wet hop or fresh hop ale. Was dying to have this beer. Great divide looks like an awesome brewery with good line up of beers especially IPAs and a lot of experimental stuff. Had it at beer tasting. Poured from a 22oz bomber.  Regular color of an IPA. Amber, slight copper hue. Small one finger thick head. Medium to low carbonation. Clear and transparent in the glass. Smell very grassy, from a distance. Prominent hops, slight citrus. Malt and sweetness is not felt at all. Taste is where it feels like heaven. Extremely hop prominent. Very distinct from other dry hopped APAs. As grassy and fresh as i have ever had. I have smelled and tasted dry, leafy and pellet hops. This one is hell a lot better. You can get a feel(smell and taste wise) of what a freshly harvested hop would be like. Smell is more pronounced when you are devouring it. Just like other APA and IPA stuff. Awesome fresh feel and it seemed to transport me into a grass guzzling panda like world. More upfront on hops and still not very bitter of APAs. Good balance between malts and the type of hops used. Mouth feel : Less oily. But very smooth. Medium bodied feel.  Excellent brew. Would certainly like to have it again and again.\n",

Appearance: It poured a hazy golden colour with a just under two finger white head that dissipated fairly quickly but left wonderful lacing. Aroma: Strong tropical notes especially pineapple, mango and peach with a touch of citrus grapefruit, orange rind and lemon juice. Taste: A fruit explosion of tropical and citrus. Mainly pineapple and mango at the beginning, before settling to a lightly bitter orange and lemon peel finish. Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall: A great and refreshing pale ale. The aroma from the Mosaic was especially nice, and feels like it could be an anytime beer for me. Having said that, I think I still slightly prefer the Citra of pseudoSue and Zombie Dust.\n",

It mentions granola...not sure I catch that...maybe a bit in the finish. The finish is very balanced between sweet and bitter. It is very smooth, especially considering the alcohol level, which is on the higher side for the style. I almost gave the overall a slight notch higher, but, while it's individual parts hit a 4, not sure it quite gets to a 4 overall. But, it's VERY close.

Faintly malty aroma. No forward smells. Faintly sweet on the taste. A little earthy. Doesn't taste at all like a traditional pale ale. I swear I can taste the granola though. Mouth is a little above medium. The finish is the problem here, it's earthy, faintly veggie, slightly bitter and quite unpleasant to this palate.

Actually, I just wrapped up my weekly W CKW2G 2nd shift gig &amp; I'm ready for a beer. From the Bottle: \"Dogfish Head and The Grateful Dead Present American Beauty Pale Ale\"; \"Pale Ale brewed with granola &amp; honey\". I Pop!ped the cap &amp; let fly with an astounding C-Line pour that raised just over a finger of dense, foamy, rocky, tawny head with decent retention, leaving nice lacing in its wake. Color was Deep Amber/Light Copper to Copper (SRM = &gt; 13, &lt; 17) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had an English Pale Ale maltiness, kinda nutty, kinda bready, slightly sweet, but not what I would consider a good example of the APA style. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was much sweeter than the style allows for. It really revealed the honey, especially as it warmed &amp; the granola, although I would not have identified it as such, lent it a breadiness that would not stop. Finish was semi-sweet &amp; I found myself wishing for some hops. I had no real problem with it in general, just that it was not stylistically correct. Sure, it was brewed as a novelty, but it suffered by being misidentified, IMHO. YMMV.\n",

Faint almond, honey, then the APA combine for a unique brew. F: surprisingly smooth for the ABV.. I attribute this to the granola. O: this is definitely worth checking out.

      "On tap at Finz in Salem, MA, where apparently they get cool DFH brews because they always have three lines dedicated to the brewery. Double IPA/American Strong brewed with granola, because we are all out of ideas. Also, I don't know why I forgive the art for Rogue's Dead Guy but find this one so repulsive. The Dead's semiotics creep me out in general, but the bears... especially the bears. Pours hazy dark gold, thick and limp. Smells like hops and grass--the weird adjunct nodes of the granola are nice and crisp and do a fantastic job cutting against the hops. Doesn't taste quite as good as it smells. The first few sips are great: giant hops up front, weedy adjunct finish, good balance. The graininess becomes heavy as the beer warms, however, with the back end getting sweeter and sweeter until the balance is thrown off. Strange. Usually with off kilter strong ales, especially old ales and barleywines, I wind up liking the beer more and more as I progress through the pint. This was the exact opposite. It never became bad, but I took my sweet time finishing it and probably won't order it again.\n",

      "Appearance: This is a beautiful beer to look at. The initial pour showed unexpectedly good head retention, even for a sticky APA like this one. A rich, rosy amber colour with fluffy, white head, and very minimal lacing (unsurprising given the 9% abv) Smell: The honey granola is immediately apparent, didn't pick up on the almonds like some others. Hops are understated, but sweet in the nose of this one. Kind of a sweet smell, overall, with not much complexity to it. Taste: Good, but falls short of great. The taste of almonds and granola are apparent, but seem trapped beneath the intense hop flavors. Very little honey shows through, but I'm okay with that. The factor that holds this brew back from greatness is the lack of harmony between the flavors. Rather than the sweet nutty start, and clean floral finish I expected, I was left with a muddled mix of flavors that seem to taper off simultaneously. Feel: I really prefer a stronger body on a brew this strong and ambitious. I feel like some interesting malt characteristics may have held the flavors together nicely, but was instead left with mild, understated mouthfeel. The carbonation is very apparent, and the well-concealed boozy-ness makes an appearance at the back of the throat. Other than that, the mouthfeel is nothing special, if not weak. This would be a great feel for a less ambitious brew, but with such a pronounced flavor, the contrast is somewhat unsettling. Overall: Pretty good, but from this brewery, I expected much more. Dogfish Head is an industry leader when it comes to Pale Ales, and I'm not sure how they went wrong with this one. From any other brewery, I would be thrilled to find this beer. Unfortunately, by a very slight margin, my expectations were not met. I'm not sure whether I would pick up this brew again. I don't want to say it wasn't good( because it really was quite good), but any store that stocks this is bound to have something better for the same price tag.\n",

Hop aroma is minimal, obviously not at optimal freshness. Taste: Light caramel with strong toasted malt notes. Moderately strong bitterness that tends to have more tropical fruit notes than other fresh hop beers that are especially resinous and grassy. Overall hop flavor is more subdued than others. Mouthfeel: Medium body with some creaminess and light to moderate carbonation. Finish: Lingering resin and grass, with a touch of toasted malt. Overall: This was on the low end of fresh/wet hopped ales I’ve had, but likely because it wasn’t at optimal freshness. Aroma was minimal, and hop flavor was lacking and dull.

A nice pine, a sharp resinous bit. A complex fruitness and a light malt honey sweetness to make it pop.  T- A perfectly balanced and moderate bittersweetness at first. A really nice mix between the honey like malt and the hop bitterness.The first flavor I get is a honey flavor, then the hop profile starts to come in. A herbal flavor at first, followed by a refreshing pine, then pine sap, then a light fruityness. A bit of lemongrass, a touch of grapefruit. A well rounded and tasty beer. M- I could drink this all day. It has a complex flavor profile that keeps it interesting and a mouthfeel that wont burn your palate. O- An awesome fresh hop ale. Arguably one of the best of the style. I'm lucky to have been able to land some as Deschutes is yet to arrive in KY. Definetely worthy of getting, especially for the price tag.\n",

      "I could have sworn I'd reviewed this before. Oh well, always happy for an excuse to buy more Deschutes. Best by: 12/24/13. 5.4% ABV according to my bottle's label. 2013 vintage. 12 fl oz brown glass bottle with great label art and branded black \"Class of 88\" pry-off cap acquired as part of a six pack at Whole Foods HQ earlier today and served into an Independence Brewing pilsner glass in me gaff in low altitude Austin, Texas. Reviewed live. Expectations are high given the brewery and style. Reviewed as a fresh hop pale ale because it clearly identifies as such on the label.  Served cold - straight from me fridge. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.  A: No bubble show forms as I pour.  Pours a two finger wide head of light khaki colour. Has an approachable smooth somewhat soft complexion. Nice creaminess and thickness. Sticky consistent lacing coats the sides of the glass as the head slowly recedes; this beer has \"legs.\" Head retention is rather good - about 7+ minutes.  Body colour is a clear translucent copper - so transparent you can read through the beer if you desire. Attractive glowing vibrance. No yeast particles are visible.  Appears adequately carbonated.  A very appealing pale ale. Definitely within style conventions. There are no overt flaws. I'm really looking forward to trying it.  Sm: The first thing I pick up is a wonderful resinous hop character, with notes of pine and grapefruit. It's got some bubblegum notes which has me worried; I can't stand that in an IPA - let alone a pale ale. There are also tropical fruit hop notes (tangerine, passionfruit, peach), which I rarely see executed well. Since it's Deschutes, I'm optimistic. There's an abundance of caramalt, which seems to be lending it a bit too much sweetness. I do pick up a slight warmth beneath the sweetness; perhaps lurking alcohol? That's quite odd for a 5.4% pale ale. As it warms slightly, I pick up some oily hop character redolent of herbs and the cannabis family. Some pale malts fill out the body, with maybe a bit of graininess buried in there too.  No yeast character is detectable.  The resinous hop notes are a highlight for me. A pleasant, welcoming aroma of mild to moderate strength. The hop profile is quite pronounced for a pale ale, which I'd attribute to the fresh hop brewing method.  T: Ah. It's always nice to take a sip of a beer from a brewery that understands balance - especially in a hoppy beer. There's a clear marriage of the sweetening malts (caramalt, pale malt, maybe some pilsner malt but I doubt it) to the bittering hops, and the flavour profile has a lovely cohesion as a result. It's seamless, though perhaps not quite gestalt. The hop profile is well-executed, with deliberately and effectively selected hop notes: great resinous hop character, some pine, floral notes, herbal notes - including a hint of that cannabis-redolent character mentioned above. It's also just a biteen oily. Luckily, I don't find too much of the tropical fruit/bubblegum character here; there's a bit of both but they're subtly integrated. It manages the dueling hop bitterness and malt sweetness expertly. Great amplitude.  No yeast character or alcohol comes through.  Overall, it's a very pleasant and approachable flavour profile with impressive complexity and subtlety for a pale ale. The balance is a highlight for me; I love it when brewers don't hop on the \"more hops/bitterness = better beer\" bandwagon (see Green Flash). Above average depth, intensity, and duration of flavour.  Mf: Nicely creamy. Smooth and wet enough to keep the beer refreshing, but also slightly coarse and dry enough to coax out the flavours. Has a good even-keeled quenching presence on the palate. Complements the flavour profile very well. Well-carbonated. Slightly oily, which works well within the beer's fresh hop premise. Good thickness and body.  Not buttery, harsh, astringent, gushed, hot, or boozy.  Dr: An inspired balanced brew from one of the best breweries in the country, Hop Trip delivers on its fresh hop concept; this isn't your usual mediocre offering that uses fresh hops as a marketing gimmick. It's a quality brew and it's priced very fairly. I'm glad I picked up a 6 pack and look forward to having another. I'll be picking this beer up every year. Extremely drinkable, sessionable stuff.  Drank great from a pilsner glass.  Would pair best with barbecue and/or fries.  B\n",

Minimally sweet though. Malts are more toasty, bicuity, and bready. Some hints of pale crystal give just a light touch of caramel. Overall, malts stay behind the hops. Slightly herbal, vaguely astringent, tea-like impression creeping around the edges and sticking around in the finish. M: Body just a hair under medium with carbonation average.

Lingering grapefruit pith and bitterness but quite subtle and understated, overall, particularly on the nose. Soft, smooth, and perfectly carbonated feel, much more substantial than the ABV would suggest. I continue to be amazed at how substantial the look and feel of Maine Beer's smaller pale ales are.

Light spicy, rye, herbal hops round out the aroma, adding some delightful dimension to the beer. Flavor profile is expressive for being so light. German, pilsner, rye, and pale malts give it a little extra spice and zest, with herbal, floral, spicy, and light citrus hops swooping over the top. It's dynamic, especially when considering the 4.2% ABV. A very enjoyable aroma and flavor quality here. Mouth feel is lighty crisp, like a soft, thin breading on flash fried fish fillet.

Crisp, dry, seltzer-like, minerally, grapefruit rinds, unripe stone fruit, pithy, pine, crackery malts, and an herbal linger. There’s a lot going on here, and in a good way.. One of the better session beers currently on the market. STYLE: Session Ale | ABV: 4.2% | AVAILABILITY: Year-round\n",

      "This is definitely my favorite beer, I even talk about it all the time. This session by Carton has everything I look for in a beer. This is my first time writing on Ba so you might not believe my 5 point rating, so let me explain. First the appearance is uniquely hazy for this type of beer (once a waitress brought me the wrong beer and I knew right away that it was not and boat beer). Secondly the aroma hits you with all kinds of beautiful hop scents, probably because it was dry hopped twice, then taste....it has all the hop flavor that you look for in an ipa but with out the heavy maltiness that might weigh down a beer with a higher alcohol content. This makes it a perfect beer especially if you want to have more than one. Obviously I am a hop head and boat beer appeals to me, but even if you are not a hop head try something from carton brewery. They have many unique delicious innovative beers I am sure everyone would find a beer they love by carton\n",

      "I enjoyed this on tap at Federal Taphouse in Harrisburg, served chilled in a pint.  The color is a cloudy golden with thin white head with fine bead and ringlets of lace stick.The smell is great with lots of floral hop aromas with mild citrus zest and slight tropical fruit in the nose. The feel is decent with tangy semi-dry and pretty bitter texture with low sweetness and semi-dry finish with moderately high carbonation and moderately bitter finish.  The taste iis tangy with lemony hop element and subtle acicidty in the taste with mild citrus golden grapefruit-like punch with somewhat herbal hop quality and grassy aspect with a light astringency level and dry finish. Overall this is better than most beers of this style but I would not want to drink more than 1 in a sitting a bit too assertive bitterness wise for the abv -pushed to the extreme in a way I am not fond of especially.\n",

      "Big thanks goes out to BilbosNuts for this one! Served from bottle into a COAST Willi. Poured a nice golden yellow with slight orange hue with a two finger slightly off-white head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, grapefruit, grapefruit hop, fruit, and very subtle pine. The flavor was of sweet malt, tropical fruit, citrus, citrus hop, grapefruit hop, fruit, and subtle grapefruit. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I was really intrigued by this one upon seeing its release from the brewery. I know RR is good at making IPA/IIPAs so I wanted to see what they could do with an APA. I can honestly say that they did quite a nice job on this one. The simcoe is a very nice hop and this brew definitely showcases this fact throughout each sip and especially in the aroma. This brew also brings a very nice balance of flavor and aroma with it as well to keep your palate intrigued throughout. Up there as one of the best APAs I’ve had, but not quite up to Zombie Dust standards as I would have LOVED to find.\n",

      "510 ml brown glass bottle with standard pressure cap served into a nonical unbranded pint glass in me friend's gaff in high altitude Castle Rock, Colorado. Reviewed live. Expectations are fairly high; I've had this before and enjoyed it for what it was. Bottled on 06/26/2012.  Served straight from the refrigerator. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.  A: Pours a three finger beige colour head of fair cream, fair thickness, and above average retention. Colour is a clear copper. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. It looks like any other pale ale, to be honest.  Sm: Simcoe hops. Clean malts. Floral character. Grapefruit citrus. A mild strength aroma.  T: Grapefruit citrus esters are dominant. The hops are cleanly cut by the malts, which help to lend it body. Slight cream. It's not horribly complex or subtle, but it's a nice little beer. Balanced but mundane.  Mf: Smooth and wet. Good thickness and carbonation. Suits the flavours pretty well.  Dr: A drinkable little single hop pale ale, but not much else. I've come to expect far more from Russian River. I wouldn't get it again unless the price dropped considerably. A bit boring, actually. Hides its ABV well. For what it is, it's good, but it's far from unique or special. Russian River has far better offerings.  B-\n",

      "Kids! Always bring back Trillium when you visit Boston! Like you didn’t know that. 16 oz. can dated 10/4/18. The pour is thick, phlegm-like yellow that smells like grapefruit perfume cut with pine. Not bad.  Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point leans hard enough into grapefruit it might fall out of the car. Grapefruit for kilometers, kiwi, spring florals, touch of mint, with a nice bitter finish. Dry. Easy enough to drink, which might be its calling card.  I can’t speak for the masses (but I will anyways), but this appears to be a classic case of “this is Trillllllium!”-itis. A good, solid beer, but nothing to rise above many others, especially with all the genuinely excellent beers in their portfolio.\n",

      "Thank you to my friends at Carmine Street Tap Room. I will always patronize an establishment that just does't sell beer, they love it. There is something pleasant about balancing the undeniable greatness of bitterness. This is something that Trillium might do better than any other brewer. Bitter is the quintessential taste that complexity finds in mastery. Well done. L: Thick like honey appearance S: Tropical almost cherry served the middle of a grapefruit T: Great fruity upfront, lingers to bitter rinds of melon, to a hint of dough, to the last drops of squeezed by hand creme  brûlée grapefruit finish F: Lighter than I expected, almost session like. Clean, with dank undertones O: Trillium is a masterful brewery, this mosaic dry hopped Fort Point pale ale is a highlight in my beer repertoire. A special note: Somehow, Trillium with their simplistic use of generic canning, with a stick and peel label, wins the packaging award of 2017.\n",

      "16oz can, undated but purchased fresh from the brewery, generously shared by DB, poured into a 10oz snifter glass. Enjoyed on 7.28.16, reviewed from Tasting Journal. The beer pours a hazy and turbid copper and gold color, white head, about a finger high with little retention but some sticky lace. The aroma is decent, really intense mosaic expression, piney, fruity, floral with some sweet, doughy malt and mineral water character that is typical Trillium. The flavors are right in line, tons of sticky pine, resinous and lightly bitter, tropical fruits sneak their way out to brighten the beer with some almost stinky malt, a bit stale but doughy yet some juiciness and fruitiness is what lingers. The mouthfeel is coating and juicy, medium body, active carbonation keeps the beer lively and crisp with an easy finish that is lightly dry. Verdict: Just a pure Mosaic hop assault on the senses. Really juicy, really piney yet moderate bitterness and pretty decent balance. That being said, Mosaic just isn't my favorite hop and while this is a good \"yeast coast\" pale ale, it's somewhat forgettable to me, especially after having the Galaxy dry hopped version about a week prior, which was a true standout for me.\n",

T: Citric zest with some floral notes, followed by the signature Fort Point biscuity finish. Incredibly full for a pale ale. M: Super smooth; very low bitterness with an extremely dry finish... Highly drinkable. O: Fantastic take on the Trillium's signature pale ale. As I've come to expect from this superb brewery, it's a highly aromatic, intensely fruity, and extremely drinkable beer. While it doesn't quite match its Galaxy-dry-hopped sibling, it's a very special pale ale nonetheless. Worth seeking out for sure.\n",

      "Bottled 4/26/2016. A 6.6% pale ale, huh? Hmm, ok. Appearance - Well, the appearance doesn't really scream 'pale ale' either as it looks almost identical to the other imperial beers from Trillium. It has a nice dark orange center before a gradient towards yellow. A small head quickly fills the glass then disappears. Aroma - The nose is pleasant but not as strong as I thought it'd be. Perhaps I'm spoiled by Trillium's mastery in their imperial IPAs, but the aroma just doesn't pop as much. It has a citrus and floral component that make up the bulk, with a slightly minty note at the end. Taste - The flavor is pretty much lock-step with the aroma, and this may be where the pale ale moniker is earned. While everything in this beer tastes enjoyable, there is a rather mundane and pedestrian barrier that I can't seem to bust through. It tries to permit entry with a juicy citrus bite, but fades as soon as the initial rush ends. Likewise, the earthy aspects are just as plain. It just doesn't have a remarkable flavor profile. Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel is medium-bodied with good carbonation. A good building block for the ingredients to jump off of, but they don't take advantage. Closing Arguments - Overall, this ranks near the bottom of all of the Trillium I've had so far, which is disappointing since the person I received it from said it was a true sleeper. Make no mistake, this isn't a bad beer, just one that isn't very memorable, especially compared to the rest of the horses in Trillium's stable.\n",

      "Service: Bottle Bottled on: Mar-16-2016 (Consumed April 29) A: Pours an impenetrably cloudy gold with an airy two fingers+ of white head that slowly settles to a chunky film. Decent retention; cloud-like patches of lacing. (4.25) S: Bright, tart, juicy peaches, with layered grapefruit and lemons, lightly resinous hop oils. (4.5) T: Dryly hoppy with a sticky citrus flavor composed of grapefruit, limes, lemons and mango with some biscuity malt in the back. (4.25) M: Medium bodied, not as creamy as their other beers, fairly active carbonation, lightly astringent (almost a tart feel), nice juicy-ish flavor with a bone dry finish. (4.25) O: A very good PA and a very nice showcase for the Mosaic to boot.  It pours about like all of their beers. Neither bad nor gorgeous, decent, fluffy cap of white, though. The smell is the winner here, with a sticky, juicy, tartish (it seriously tickled my nose), grapefruit/lemon rind/stonefruit aroma. The flavor is a little more subdued with lots of similar flavors (especially oily, tart, bitter citrus )coming through. Not a lemon bomb or anything, but it really highlights, oily, vaguely tart, dry lemony flavors throughout with juicy tropical highlights and a thicker woody/sappy vein and some malt in the background.  Very drinkable, extremely hoppy, a nice balance (though it seems pretty IPA-ey, I don't know).  I would definitely have it again. (4.5)\n",

      "Poured from the bottle into a 12oz. Kane Brewing tulip glass. Look - Pours a hazy orange with a nice fluffy 2 finger head. Lacing lingers on the glass. Smell - Strong notes of papaya, mango, and other tropical fruits thanks to the mosaic. Citrus, pine, and a light aroma of hops are also present. Taste - This is where the mosaic hops really shine. Those tropical fruits come through as soon as it hits your palate. There's a bit of pine and hoppiness towards the end that really pulls the beer together.  Mouthfeel - A beautiful, medium bodied beer with a lighter feel. Finishes dry, almost like a red wine (without the flavor, of course). Overall - Just WOW! I love Trillium's original Fort Point, but the addition of mosaic hops really made this beer much more special. I'd have to go ahead and say that so far, this is my favorite (non-stout) Trillium offering!\n",

      "I love regular Fort Point Pale Ale. Like love. So, I was pretty geeked to give this one a whirl, especially as I tend to dig Mosaic. Right out of the bottle, the differences were apparent, this brew far less hazy than regular Fort Point (although it seems like the haze levels have been varying lately. The one I had in Nov. '14 was murky as hell.) That said, it's still a pretty looking brew, a nice light, \"signs of ample dry hopping\" cloudiness, with nice foam and retention (Trillium brews tend to be great on that account). Nose is lighter and a little less saturated than normal for Trillium (it paled in comparison, for example, to the bottle of Pier I had a few days prior). Some light herbal notes -- cilantro maybe? perhaps a light hint of scallion? -- plus a little bit of sweet, tropical fruit and, as the glass wears on, a touch of pine. Palate is quite spritzy with the carb, and that combines with a pretty crackery malt profile to make this one less well-rounded and full feeling as regular FPPA. It kinda made me think of Ballast Point's Grunion (which I just checked does feature Mosaic hops, so there you go. Self-congratulatory pat-on-back accomplished), except that I think Grunion better features the Mosaic and has a slightly more agreeable malt profile. Don't get me wrong, this is a nice, tasty brew, but it doesn't have that \"Wow\" factor like Trillium's better offerings. As for me, give me good, old FPPA any day.\n",

      "Bottle date smudged. Bottled in October which is clear. Today is October 17. Fresh specimen, especially for a Californian.  Nice and crisp. Clean beer and clean bitterness that keeps you coming back for more, sip after sip.  Oranges, Tangerines, Peaches &amp; &amp; Mangoes. This runs the Guantlet of bright citrus fruits. This is focused on Mosaic, so garlic and Onion make themselves known here &amp; there. Fruits are juicy and up front. Pine stays on the back end which works well keeping it dry and leaving you wanting more sip after sip. Solid IPA. However, as powerful as the \"everything hop\" Mosaic is, the Garlic &amp; Onion it brings to the table, no matter how subtle it is, brings flaws. Awesome beer. Minor knit-picking on my end.

The nose has somewhat restrained hop presence with some pineapple and guava fruit notes. Mouthfeel is delicate, clean, with a medium light body. The taste opens with an interesting spicy hop character, then a delicate pale malt middle, a well balanced, slightly firm bitterness which is pleasant and clean, then a touch of spicy hops in the finish. Clean throughout, no flaws. This is an interesting beer. It's bare bones, simple, spicy, well balanced, easy to drink, but quite flavorful for 5.4% and very well brewed.

      "I had this on tap at the Goose Island Bar at O'Hare. It was refreshing and nice compared to my choices at the other establishments. As far as american pale ales, I felt this was a little lacking and considering its a specialty release for the Chicago area I expected something a little more premium.

      "Poured on tap in a 6oz tumbler at a Beer Garden we found in Chicago. Review is from my notes. Pours a slightly hazy blond pale color complete with carbonation at the top that resembles soapy suds of sorts. Carbonation rises modestly in this, but it's nothing too large or cascading. Lots of lacing sticks to the glass here, and combined with the color, this looks a lot more like an American wheat ale of sorts than a standard APA. At the aroma, I'm getting actual wheat, lime, coriander, and lots of golden grains, combined with a soapy, slightly bittered finish. Sure there's no wheat in this thing and it isn't a bastardization of Hoegaarden or something? Okay, politics aside, and reminding myself I actually like Goose Island, this smells pretty pleasant overall if only slightly underwhelming. (Their website lists this as having no wheat, by the way.) The citrus becomes ever more prominent as this warms up, and a lot of dried lemon notes really come to the front by the end. Not too much of a malty character as well, although it does eventually seep in. As expected the flavor is filled with crisp grains, soapy hops, some faded spices (especially on the coriander), and a nicely carbonated character that accentuates these flavors. Definitely has all the characteristics of a summer beer with its crispness, medium body, and lemon and pear induced fruitiness. None of the flavors are too explosive, but they balance out decently well - although a lot more of the yeasty character could some pepping up. Easy to drink, but not too memorable. A rather commonplace yet decent take on all of the spring/summer releases (although this one is year-round as it seems), but not bad to have this while sitting in the sun on a rare warm day in the Midwest spring. I'm not too impressed by any of Goose Island's year-round releases like this one but it's relatively inoffensive and quite easy to drink. Wasn't my favorite, but it was an appropriate choice to use to deviate from a lot of the crazy beers I got to try in Chicago.\n",

T - Toasted biscuit and earthy fruit flavors upfront. The body has an appropriate amount of resiny hop flavor lingering in the background from dry hopping, but doesn't exactly fit well with the almost perfume like floral notes. The finish is an awkward blend of flower stems and hop resin.  M - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Fine, but nothing special. Most Pale Ale's are hit or miss for me, and Odell's St. Lupin was off the mark.

Towards the finish a dry spicy/bready malt combo emerges and rounds out the sweet hop flavors previously mentioned. Definitely a true pale ale with the malt cutting through the hops before any bitterness manifests itself. In other words its very balanced. Feel- Medium carbonation and medium bodied. The feel is very smooth and almost pillowy. Very easy to drink with a dry/clean finish. Overall- Great pale ale that I wish I had more of when I was in NC. Very balanced but both sides of the beer clearly show themsleves with flavorful hops adding grapefruit and citrus flavors at first and the malt adding a spiced/bready flavor in the finish. Very flavorful, balanced, and the dry finish plus the pillowy feel makes this a easy drinker. Definitely need to buy more of this and especially for the beach.\n",

      "*Pale* ale is no kidding - this supposed rye beer is light enough to be straight-up yellow in colour (not even close to golden) and has the radiance of the sun's surface. How much rye could have been used? One Claw's appearance wouldn't indicate anything darker than pale malt was included (unless the cloudy, completely turbid complexion is any indication).  Perhaps it should come as no surprise, but the dial of this aroma is firmly set to 'hops' and the reception is sparklingly clear. Grapefruit pith, pineapple skin and orange peel are combined with grassy, earthy, jasmine-touched scents of green and white tea - it could double as an herbal cold remedy (and there's enough bitterness to assume it'll work too!).  Some rye beers are dark, chewy, heavy, nutritious - like German bread with muscles. But as outlined in the first two paragraphs, this is far more about bright hoppiness than it is rye graininess. The taste is comprised almost entirely of hop-supplied flavours: citrus blossoms, tropical fruits, fresh-cut grass. The malts are only secondary, providing but minor notes of biscuit and bread.  Indeed, for a beer that advertises its rye content there's disappointingly none of the expected or sensational spicy grain notes and not even a hint of caramelization. Despite our special ingredient this tastes quite the same as any number of pale ales. That's not an inherently bad thing - this is hoppy but balanced, tremendously drinkable - but it's nothing more than a basic quaff.  One Claw may have rye on the ingredients list but it really contributes nothing to this humble, simple pale ale. Sure, the hops are firing on all cylinders - which is great - and I get it, hoppy pale ales have become an American brewer's birthright, but this isn't exactly what I showed up for. Don't get me wrong: there's no need to change the recipe - just the description on the can.\n",

Look- Clear honey color, nice frothy off-white head that recedes quickly, leaving a decent amount of lacing. Good amount of carbonation visible in the glass as it sits. Smell- Pine, citrus, caramel malt, a little bit of berries, floral herbs and oats. Taste- Pine, citrus (grapefruit, lemon pith), sweet caramel, bready grains, slight melon and a bit of booze.  Feel- Medium-heavy bodied, somewhat sweet and thick on the tongue, slightly creamy. Decent carbonation. They did a good job of masking the 80 IBUs, minimal bitterness.

      "I keep coming back to this ale over and over. Besides the fact that Lagunitas price point is ridiculously affordable, this ale easily surpasses other ales that are priced three or four times as much. After drinking a Stone 19th Anniversary Thunderstruck IPA (Also a great ale, don't get me wrong), this ale hit the spot again. I have probably enjoyed at least a dozen of these 22 oz. Equinox ales, and this was perhaps the best. In this instance the malt stood out as the star, whereas we normally play a game of name that tropical fruit. maybe the straight forward IPA that I had prior to this blew that aspect, but oh well. The malts taste amazing, and the papaya flavor is still there for me. Once again, Lagunitas shines on their special releases! At about $4 / 22 oz, you just can't beat the flavor here. As a former Stone addict at $7 a piece, I prefer Lagunitas 99% of the time. Equinox is rad!!!\n",

Dry to slightly bitter finish. m: Smooth medium, great body and good carbonation tingle. o: An interesting ale with oatmeal-stoutlike smooth body and mouthfeel but American pale ale-like hop bite.

      "Pours a clear medium gold, white head settles quickly. Very clear. Aroma is an interesting blast of pine, eucalyptus, sea breeze, spruce, and a little citrus Taste is on the sweet side, hop notes follow the aroma with some additional herbal notes (basil, rosemary). Nice bitterness follows in the aftertaste, a little surprising for a fairly big beer with only 50 IBU Mouthfeel is nice and creamy but not overly heavy. More CO2 bite would be nice In terms of classic styles, this is a hard beer to pigeon hole, so I can't argue against lumping it into APA. A good lookin' brew, especially in terms of clarity, but lack of carbonation makes the nice look at the pour drop quickly. Aroma is exquisite hop melange... I'm not highly familiar with the Equinox hop variety, but based on this brew I want to be. Mouthfeel has a decent creaminess from the oat, but I miss the carbonation sting... essentially near-still after the initial bloom. But you can't hate on a beer that tastes and smells this good... I will definitely grab another.\n",

      "ordered a Double Dry Hop Pseudo Sue from Tavour. Given its reputation and its scarcity in NY, expectations are high.  It pours an extremely hazy liquid that looks like freshly squeezed grapefruit juice. The carbonation is visible, as is a gentle and ruminating modest bubbly head that leaves lacing in its wake. In the nose there is initially an herbal, grassy and slightly dank quality. These aromas retain throughout albeit pushed a bit to the background as more fruity and juicy aromas take center stage. Hints of orange pulp, mango, and papaya fill the nose, as does a crackery malt backbone. As I put the glass to my lips it is soon apparent this will be something special. Smooth, juicy and dry all at the same time. Grapefruit pith, orange peel, hints of tropical fruit against a malt texture that evokes fullness and a touch of sweetness. Generously hopped in terms of bitterness, flavor and mouthfeel; earthy, piny, prickly, yet smooth and accessible. Slightly creamy with a medium body.  Tasty, complex and full of flavor. Honestly one of-if not-the best Pale Ales I’ve ever had. Worth the hype!!\n",

      "Wow, just wow. Poured out of a bomber bottled 2/24/17, fresher than fresh! I'll start this out by stating that I've never had a NE IPA, but I would imagine that the look of this beer is incredibly similar. Sits in the glass a hazy yellow/orange, almost looks like a glass of pineapple or orange juice. Nice fluffy 2 finger head. Obviously it's a double hopped citra so the nose is pineapple, mangos, stone fruit, citrusy juices, and a little bit of orange peels. It tastes almost exactly as it smells, it's definitely a juice bomb with the faintest bit of bitterness at the end, maybe the slightest touch of pine. The mouthfeel is incredible. It feels like a smoother, fuller taste. I get this from Decorah Sue as well as King Sue as well, but I believe this one to be even more pillowy. There still is a bit of carbonation and crispness to it as well. Overall, I've been waiting a while to get my hands on this beer and it definitely lived up to the hype! I saw it listed on the To-Go list on their website this morning so my wife jumped in her car and made the 2 hour drive. This beer is fantastic! I bought 9 bombers of it and am incredibly happy that I did. At 2 days old, they will last me a little while. Can't say enough good things about TGB's beers, especially their entire \"Sue\" line.\n",

      "This was one of my “gateway” beers years ago when I discovered craft beer. It holds a special place in my heart, but is an admittedly an old fashioned American Pale Ale. It pours an orange copper with a nice white head. Hints of classic C hop citrus and malt on the nose. Taste is malt-hop balanced with caramel-leaning malt and a little nice citrus &amp; grassy hop flavor.  This is a solid drinking beer.

      "Look - Poured from a 12 oz. bottle with a nice hazy orange color and medium carbonation. Nice thick head, foamy on the top with oversized lower bubbles near the base. Very nice look. Smell - Nothing special here. Smells like a Pale Ale (IMAGINE THAT!) Good hoppy, floral, citrus mix. Taste - Standard Pale Ale. Hoppy and bitter, but not overpowering. Very well balanced and pleasant. Mildly dry on the finish. Feel - Medium weight/body. Well balanced carbonation (not too much, not too little). Crisp and clean. Overall - This is a good beer for just about any occasion. Want to enjoy something refreshing after mowing the lawn or on a warm spring evening? Try this one. Want to have something nice at dinner? Try this one. Need something good for a party? Try this one. Extra Notes - Like much (but not all) of Boulevard's brews, this one is the standard for it's type. And when I say \"standard,\" I do not mean \"Gold Standard,\" just standard. What that means is, you will find nothing particularly special about it, but for it's type (in this case an American Pale Ale) it's the standard. Not \"average,\" as \"average\" carries with it negative connotations. But when you think of an APA, this is the standard that you imagine.

      "Boulevard is 23 years old today! 23 years to the day since they rolled out their first (for sale) keg of Pale Ale. Figured I ought to review one as a toast. Presentation: 12oz brown stubby pop top with nice (if simple) label; best-by date of 3/29/13 clearly stamped. Bottle-conditioned. Into Pumking globe.  Appearance: This pours a sliiiightly hazy (from bottle conditioning) copper/orange brew with a nice cream-colored cap which shows decent retention.  Smell: This is very much about the hops; this brew uses Cascade, Magnum, Palisade, Simcoe, and Styrian Goldings, so perhaps it's not surprising that no one hop characteristic is jumping out at me. The overall character is fruity, slightly earthy, and perhaps with the slightest hint of citrus. Very slight toasty malt aroma. Still the hops are soft, not at all sharp or brash. Pleasant, if nothing stand-outish. Taste: Firm, bracing bitterness (30 IBUs) almost balanced by Pale, Munich, and two types of crystal malts. Not quite as citrusy/peachy/fruity as the last time I had it on tap, the hops here are lightly herbal, earthy, but still a bit of that peachy stone-fruit character that I really like. Just a hint of candied lemon as it warms. Also, not quite as much (toasty) malt as I remember it having on tap. Regardless, this is still a nice quaff.  Mouthfeel: On the light side of medium Overall: A bit more than the sum of its parts. It's not a beer to think about or a draught that causes one to wax poetic, but it's a dead-solid American Pale, and I find it quite drinkable, even though I'm much more of an English Pale Ale guy. Especially on sale at $6.99, you'd be hard pressed around here to find a better stand-by, 'fridge' beer. If you're looking for something in that style, I actually prefer it over SNPA.  86--B\n",

Since then, we have seen Pounder CANs, SlimLine CANs (think Red Bull), Crowlers &amp; now the latest, Stovepipe CANs (19.2-fl. oz.). Today's side-by-side with CANsist of a 12-fl. oz. CAN, followed by a Stovepipe CAN. How exciting! No? Just to me? Oh, well.  From the 12oz mini-keg CAN: \"... I asked her 'Where do we go from here? Who IS my partner in crime?' and then it struck me, like an arrow, right between the eyes ...\"; \"As the River Styx froze and the final pig took flight, when the last winged monkey departed the darkly fragrant Netherlands, as wishes became horses and all the beggars rode ...\"; \"... under a newly-blued moon at dawn on the very 12th of Never: the second-to-last craft brewery in America pressed the green 'start' button on their canning line. We wanted to be the Last Small Brewer in the U.S. to can their beer and maybe, finally, by now, we are ...\"; \"The '12th of Never Ale' is everything we've learned about making hop-forward beer expressed in a moderate voice. Pale, cold, slightly alcoholic, and bitter. It's all we know. Call us sometime - 707.769.4995\"; \"Cheers!'  Pulling up on the pretty purple tab until I heard a loud Crack!, I was reminded of my very early childhood when purple was absolutely my favorite color. My mother owned a beautiful purple dress made of a rough fabric &amp; I even had a birthday cake with purple frosting one year. Purple remains a stunning color &amp; this CAN really stood out from the others. I CANducted a slow, gentle Glug into the awaiting glass, followed by an in-glass swirl which raised just over a finger of foamy, rocky, bone-white head with decent retention, leaving behind great lacing in its wake. Color was a gorgeous Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 - 5) with NE-plus quality clarity, bringing The Gelt Gang of Mammon, Midas &amp; Croesus running in to have a taste. Nose smelled like, well, I am going to agree with teramous here &amp; say, Tropical Fruit Cup! Mango, papaya, guava &amp; pineapple all came to play in this one. Mmm. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste, while fruity, was not as pronounced as it had been on the nose. What I did get in abundance, however, was Kellogg's Puffed Wheat, which I CANflated with their Puffa Puffa Rice, both of which I ate at my maternal grandparents' house as a kid. I thought that it was Puffa Puffa Wheat until I looked it up. Puffed wheat with pineapple! We used to have A&amp;P Pineapple Juice in a CAN at breakfast. Oh my, this was liquid nostalgia. Finish was semi-dry, not as sweet as I may have been making it out to be. I really enjoyed this little trip down memory lane &amp; I will let my grandparents know the next time that I go to visit them. They are buried in St. Anthony's Cemetery, across from Burrowes ES, where I ocCANsionally substitute teach. From the 19.2-fl. oz. Stovepipe CAN: \"... I was walking down the street, just couldn't keep from cryin'. That girl I love, she sure was on my mind ...\", plus the previous verbiage.  The Crack! was louder than ever! I shoulda worn hearing protection. What? I signaled the crane operator to swing the boom around so that I could lift this monster long enough to begin a Glug. Nothing had really changed, other than the size of the CAN. Loads of tropical fruit flavors, especially pineapple, along with puffed wheat. Here, it comes down to price point and capacity. If it were cheaper by the fl. oz. in the mini-keg, that would win out. However, if it were cheaper in the Stovepipe, I would have to CANsider just how many I CAN open &amp; drink before filling the tank. I might even take a devil-may-care attitude &amp; go with the Stovepipes just to see how far I CAN get. YMMV.\n",

I really enjoyed it the first time so I'm looking forward to actually reviewing it now. This beer pours a hazy, orangish-amber hue that shows off light carbonation and is topped with a thick, frothy, off white head that has just a hint of orange to it. The head dissipates ultra slowly to a rocky layer with a neck. 3.75/5 The aroma is big on tropical fruits, almost like canned mixed tropical fruits, and features an undertone of pine resin as well. The resin is muted, but the malt base adds a sweetness that lets the sharpness of the resin come through nicely. 3.75/5 The flavor profile starts off with a nice kick of biscuit and caramel sweetness and slowly bleeds into the hops with the tropical fruits returning as well as that familiar bit of pine resin. I don't necessarily get the citrus that the description on the bottle says. Bitterness is very light as the bottle says and does not linger after swallowing. 3.75/5 This is a medium bodied beer that is somewhat creamy and sticky. It is really not dry at all and is very minimal in terms of astringency. Carbonation is very light. 3.75/5 This is a well rounded APA that is well balanced between malt and hop with minimal bitterness, which makes this beer very thirst quenching (something that most APAs can't attest to doing). 3.75/5 Well developed flavor profile which matches the aroma nicely. 3.75/5\n",

      "A very clouded-over burnt orange sunset color promises much in the way of hop presence. There are even some floaters (presumably yeast) and I don't mind that. I know a lot of beer drinkers snub their nose at it, but I like it. The head is a creamy off-white beauty. Big citrus notes in the nose, also some peach, red apple and a little pear. Slighter shades of pine. Caramel-like sweetness offers balance. Definitely a hop-forward pale ale, one of those beers that tastes big without the big ABV. The only thing that keeps it from feeling total west coast is the generous malt layer, like caramel or toffee taffy, sweet and (thanks to the hops, surely) a bit salty. Herbal/pine notes linger, especially prominent in the finish. Slight medicinal twang going on too, but not annoyingly so, and it's the thing that pushes down an almost creamsicle-like overall personality. Maybe more baby aspirin than anything... seriously, think \"baby aspirin\" when you drink this. You'll see. (And hey, I dig baby aspirin...) Texturally it's smooth and on the softer side, but carbonated enough to provide some energy.  Of all the great Hop pun beer names out there, Hopalicious is one of the least creative. But who cares? It's the quality of the beer itself that counts, and this one is excellent on all the levels that matter. Bottom line: super solid and super satisfying.\n",

      "I got HOPALICIOUS with a nonic pint. A very big thank you to Geneseohawk! Appearance- The foam is bright white and gets to two fingers in width with a craggy lid. The foam is puffy and creamy and looks wet. The body is a hazy amber-gold with no visible carbonation. Smell- The nose is a little hoppy with a citrus and piney note. The citrus is most like lemon. There is also musty quality here. Taste- The malt is pretty sweet and does a nice job of making this drink smooth. The biscuit malt is the first thing on the palate, and is quickly followed by the not over the top flavor hops.  They are peppery, a little piney, and have a hint of grassiness. Not as much citrus here as I picked up on the nose. It instead has that fresh grass flavor. The finish has barely any bitterness, but just enough, and introduces an earthy note.  Mouth feel- Very creamy and easy to drink, there is not much more you could ask for in this nice medium bodied beer. Overall- This beer has just enough flavor hops and a solid malt backbone to be a wonderfully balanced pale ale. The hops could be even more pulled out and explored in my opinion, especially if you are going to call it Hopalicious.\n",

Bubbles slowly rising from the bottom. T&amp;M: Pretty darn bitter towards the end. A little bit spicy toward the end. This beer is pretty one sided, not much going on malty-wise. Well hopped for a pale. On the watery side of medium very close to being low bodied, medium to high amounts of carbonation. Its refreshing.

A: this beer is by no means clear, it cloudy and hazy. Yellow to golden in color with the best looking head I've ever seen on a beer. Lacing is thick and sticks to the glass in heavy sheets. This beer is beautiful to look at.  S: what an amazing aroma, pure Citra. Pineapple, Grapefruit, Dragonfruit heavy in the nose. Reminds me of the last time I drank Zombie Dust. They should make an air freshner that smells like this.  T: citrus hops bitterness with a very soft roundness to the beer. It's not harsh like most heavily hopped IPA's or Pale Ales. It's easy as hell to drink with the lower abv. Beer finishes dry and has a very light malt back bone. Tons of pineapple in the flavor.  M: the softness of the beer beings out the oils in the hops, it's oily but very easy drinking. No alcohol is noticed. I could drink the entire 2l in one sitting, if I had to.

Good strategy for this style. The citra hops are still there, just not in your face, tons of citrus fruits, oranges and grapefruits...The taste is right on the nose, a malty citra beer, caramel mixed with citrus.

My large Italian nose picks up faint, citrusy hops and a bit bready malts. But its not overly pronounced. Taste is biting hop forward but then mellows out by the end into the malt backbone.

Tangerine is present coupled with a hint of orange. Deep in the background is a subtle note of passion fruit. The base is slightly bready malt. The complexity is outstanding but intensity is a bit lacking. Nice light medium body with a smooth almost slick texture. The carbonation / body balance is very good. A bit more effervescence and it becomes outstanding. The middle is prickly as is the finish. it just lacks a bit of punch. The flavor profile is very good but lacks the complexity of the nose. It does have outstanding intensity, especially for an APA. It fails to separate well. What arrives is tasty but is not a thrill ride for the palate. It is a blended flavor that has citrus, mostly implied by sweet tangerine zest. The bready malt sweetness is available for contrast, but goes unutilized except for a brief subtle note of tropical fruit. Bitterness is mild to moderate and is zest based.

Finishes a bit sweet sticky, big bitterness more herbal tea and earthy spicy hops lingering Mouth is med to a bit heavier bod, sweet sticky a bit. Overall meh, not only is this not a very special IPA, it's just as boring as many of the other Stone IPAs that are just earthy spicy herbal hops with tons of sweet malts, way too much on darker copper caramel malts, all the hops at the beginning of the boil and get no good characters from them, none of the Galaxy and PNW hops they mention. \"Rippin swell of juicy hops\"... my-ass!\n",

Taste is very smooth and packed with Pinnaple, mangos, lemon and grapefruit rinds. Some light grass there too with a very small but yet still discernible malt presence.

      "Tired Hands Hop Hands A: The flagship pale ale of the progenitors of the \"milkshake\" branch of NE IPAs pours a very pale yellow with just tinges of orange. True to substyle, it is cloudy, but not ridiculous, \"milkshake\" levels. The two fingers of snow white, meringue-like head linger seemingly forever, and lacing is excellent. 4.75/5 A: Grapefruit, peach, and lemongrass are the most prominent aromas, but there are also backing scents of grass, light pine, and herbs, plus maybe a little juicy orange and some citrus pith. Doughy yeast and crackery malt play entirely supporting roles. This is a nice-smelling pale ale with not too much going on, but positively it avoids the pitfall of being simply a low ABV IPA by not being overly intensely hopped. 4/5 T: Again, props must be given for Tired Hands crafting a true pale ale, and a very tasty one at that. The hoppiness is prominent with mainly grapefruit, some lemongrass, herbaceousness, lemon candy, some pine, and just a little peach. There is a mild, pithy bitterness that never becomes overbearing and serves as brilliant balance. The malts remain crackery and dry, and the yeast contributes a doughiness that may be divisive. The balance here is excellent, and this drinks like a very nice take on the somewhat lost pale ale style. Some of it does come across a little muted, unfortunately. 4.25/5 M: Here is where the true genius of this beer shines. The body is creamy and full on account of the oats, yet the finish is pleasantly dry and fully attenuated. Carbonation is soft and perfect. Flavor-wise it does drink fairly close to its 4.8%, but the mouthfeel is of that a beer double its strength, yet somehow it still remains amazingly drinkable as well. 5/5 O: This is a beer that is greater than the sum of its parts. Despite the very different styles of brewing, this actually drinks a lot like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, but much fuller and a tad more complex. That is a complement of the highest order, especially since this is a lower ABV than that legendary, archetypal beer. It is a very complete, well-crafted product from start to finish, and some may even interpret the muted aromas and flavors as \"subtle\" rather than \"weak.\" It is nice to still see genuine pale ales of this caliber being made. Pair with Bad Rabbits acoustic EP \"Dusted.\" 4.5/5\n",

      "From a 650 ml bottle (bottled August 8, 2013) into a tulip. A-This is good-looking beer. A normal to aggressive pour generates about three fingers of shiny white head. Retention is pretty good with the head dropping to a thick cap after about two minutes. Lacing is chunky and sporadic on the glass. The beer is clear and yellowish golden in color, with a bit of visible carbonation. S-There is a nice dose of tropical citrus hop flavors, e.g., pineapple, orange, tangerine, and orange rind. Malt flavors are mostly hidden beneath the hops, but there is a bit of grain and toasted bread. Bitterness is very mild. T-The taste is slightly more pungent and grainy than the smell with more soapy bitterness from the hops, more graininess, and more caramel flavor from the malts. The orange (and especially orange rind) flavors balance pretty well with the grain and lightly toasted bread flavors from the malt. A pleasing, but not mind-blowing balance of flavors. M-The feel was very lightly carbonated with a wet presence on the palate. Heft was light to medium. O-This is a good looking APA, and one worth drinking, but I have had better examples of the style. The smell, while pleasing, was a touch on the hoppy side (I would have ranked it higher if this was an IPA), and the taste was a bit tinny and grainy, instead of sharp and dry, like I like my APAs.

Lots of other citrus notes including oranges and lemons. Hint of tropical fruits especially pineapple which seems to be the most noteable. Just a hint of bready malts.  Taste: mild bitterness and a surprisingly decent amount of bready sweetness from the malts. At least when you consider the nose, I didnt expect to find this much of a malt backbone in the beer. Pine, grapefruit, oranges, pineapples, and a hint of lemons. It is a little bit grassy too. Mild bitterness consistantly through the beer and finish is also a mild bitterness than doesnt seem to overpower or build any bitterness through out the drink.  Mouthfeel: light bodied beer with low end of medium carbonation. Nice drinkability with this APA.  Overall: The big surprise was the malts. This beer was a bit sweeter than I expected. Its a good malt profile, but I was wanting more hop flavors. The bitterness of the APA was spot on. So if the malts can be tamed down a little bit and the hops can be more flavorful with becoming more bitter, this beer would skyrocket in mass appeal. Good APA, but has serious potential for greatness with a few tweaks of the recipe.\n",

It definitely has spice and floral notes abut diacetyl and butter flavors. It doesn't have the robust juicy hop character as I was hoping, yet I am drinking it a ways past absolute freshness.  The flavor is balanced very well. The hops sport a leafy (maybe even spinach) flavor, with a smidgen of lemon lime citrus. The malt is certainly pronounced, especially in the biscuity finish. I take that back now that it is sitting unsipped for a minute or two; the hop bitterness begins to resurface from the depths superseding the bready malt character.

I don't know what to think about the little chunks. Kinda cool, so I am kicking the rating up a little.  S: Muted orange and floral. A little bread. A little pepper? I'd like a little more, but no real complaints. T: Seems to get more of the sour part of the orange, not juicy. But there's little zest kick, either. It's just off a bit. Malt undertones. I think a bit more hops would be good, more Citra hops especially, but there's enough for IPA drinkers to like. A little aftertaste of that rind.  M: Sometimes you feel a little chunk on your tongue. Slick, not dry. I don't taste the alcohol as some other reviewers did.  O: I've had a couple different blood orange pale ales now, and maybe it is just me but it seems a difficult style to nail. There's better pale ales, and there are worse. It's a good taste for a hot day, and I am going to kick in a little rating bump for the chunks: as silly as this may seem, it makes it seem a little more crafty, and any chef knows appearance counts.

Appearance: This is one of the more murky Pale Ales I've ever seen and it says nothing about being unfiltered. It does keep an okay white head though and it's color is... On point orange. Overall, not a beauty. 2.50 Scent: You pick up a fair amount of citrus hops and a slight orange scent. But not necessarily blood orange. Taste: I don't really taste much blood orange here, and the beer tastes more like an IPA than a Pale. If I am rating this on a fruit beer, it is probably as low as I can go. As an APA? Below average but not awful. 2.75 Mouth: It has an on point middle bodied Pale Ale mouthfeel with appropriate carbonation. No complaints. If you are looking for a fruit beer (as you may initially think it is) it is awful. If you are looking for an APA, it is more like an APA/AIPA 'tweener.

Capped by a finger or so of weak head that surprisingly manages to persist. Lots of lacing on the glass. Smell is slightly dank, lots of pine and resin, with a solid citrusy backbone. Very perfumey. Pineapple, mango. But also a decent bit of malty backbone--some biscuit, bread. Slightly peppery. Taste is much the same. Initial dank, piney resin with a touch of citrus, and a surprising malt base from which it stems. Great balance after an initial bitter kick. Good body (especially for the ABV), and moderate carbonation. We're here, we're session IPAs. Get used to it. As good an entry into the crowded field as I've had the chance to try, this one could fool you--it's a much bigger, richer, more flavourful beer than its ABV would suggest.

For the modest abv/light body, it holds together well. One of the better (if not best) \"session\" IPA's that I have had. Great choice for a hoppy brew with modest abv and a lighter body.

      "My dear cousin, Colby ChANdler, specialty brewer at Ballast Point B.C. (yes, he is my cousin and yes, that is his job title), has seen the light and begun putting his brewery's beers into CANs! I will take full credit for encouraging him to make the switch, although he probably begs to differ. This CAN is out of The Fridge's cooler. From the CAN: \"Handcrafted &amp; CANned in San Diego, California\"; \"Dedicated to the Craft\"; \"San Diego Session Ale\"; \"Please Recycle\"; \"A Flavorful Ale That Keeps You Balanced\"; Our Even Keel is a hoppy ale designed for smooth sailing. A full-flavored beer with a silky malt backbone and bright hop profile of herbs and citrus, it packs all the taste of an IPA in a sessionable alcohol content. This ale is perfect for leisurely days on the water, when all you want are a few beers and a level ride.\" The Crack! unleashed a good bit of foam through the blowhole, so there would be no inverted Glug. Instead, I utilized the same leeward pour as for the Hop Stalker with both glass and CAN at an angle with the pour going down the side of the vessel. Arrgh! We be takin' on some foam, mates! Back off on the throttle and prepare to drop anchor as necessary! Avast heavin' on the sails! We be on a starboard list and need to get back on an Even Keel. Color was a solid Amber (SRM = &gt; 7, &lt; 9) with NE-quality clarity. The two fingers of dense, tawny head fell like the mizzenmast in yesterday's gale. Nose smelled of our cargo of grapefruit, pine trees and hemp. Hemp line, that is. Ye want to get us boarded? We struck the Jolly Roger so as not to call attention to ourselves, but this ship be a beast with loose CANnons rolling around and a mast CANsigned to Davy Jones' Locker. We look a sight on every one of the Seven Seas and every ship in sight thinks we be in distress. If we CAN keep her on an Even Keel until we make port in CAN Diego, CANifornia, it'll be a miracle! That's why I be drinkin' beer - to calm me nerves. Mouthfeel be medium-to-full with a boatload of carbonation. The taste leaves something to be desired, like taste! Arrgh! Aroma hops be not bittering hops, boyo! I needs me them hops to stave off the hops monkey on me back that I picked up in Shanghai! This brew be for the scullery crew. As captain of this motley crew, I CANnot stand for low ABV and low bitterness. A CANmand decision: if we CANnot come back to an Even Keel, we will jettison the rest of the store of this beer as Ballast and Point to the nearest landfall. Finish was rather bland and nondescript and so we began heavin' the barrels over the side to ride higher and faster. I put them Ballast Point scurvy dogs in a lifeboat and set them to their own devices. I hear tell that the magnificent artist, Paul Elder, captured their plight in a painting.\n",

Appearance: Golden with a slight haze and a moderate head, not much lace. Unusual carbonation with visible tiny bubbles or sediment suspended in solution.  Smell: More like a lager than an ale: malty yeasty sweet, little to no hops  Taste: Bready yeast with a crisp hop balance and some spicy bitterness in the aftertaste. Well crafted, nothing harsh about it. I’m particularly curious about this strain of ale yeast.

Smells of malt, light caramel, corn or wet brown rice like a macro lager, grass and mild spices; nose did not match the looks and was quite boring, which surprised me.  Tastes of malt, lemon zest, light caramel, faint piney hops, very light coriander, biscuit and then like the nose there was corn or like a macro adjunct lager, grass and herbs; easy to put down and sessionable if you’re not looking for flavor, but damnit this is a Bell’s brew and I expect it to taste very good if not great.  Mouthfeel is very light and almost watery, with mild to average carbonation, a thin, slick feel and a slightly grainy bitterness to end it. Overall it was nothing special and actually went downhill after the pour. Not sure why it’s so dull, but it is and seemed like any old lager that you could grab at a 7-11.\n",

Expectations are high given the brewery. 5.2% ABV confirmed. Packaged 07/29/13. Reviewed as a pale ale because of the name, though the label description calls it a blond ale.  Served cold - straight from the fridge - and allowed to warm over the course of consumption. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated. A: No bubble show forms as it's poured. Pours a one finger wide head of white colour. Disappointingly thin. Lacks creaminess and frothiness. Consistency is smooth. Complexion is decent; not particularly soft or supple. Head retention is average - about 2 minutes. Little lacing clings to the sides of the glass as the head recedes.  Body colour is a hazy nontransparent translucent mango colour. Sort of a reddish orange - kind of hard to pin down. Average vibrance. No floating yeast particles are visible. Overall, it looks a bit off for a pale ale. Not as light or clear as I'd expect.  Sm: Honey, caramel, pale malts, fruity tones (mainly mango and vague tropical character), a hint of graham cracker, clean yeast, sweet bready malts, and some doughiness from the yeast. Not as hop-forward as you'd expect (and want) in a pale ale.  I'm looking forward to trying it, but it's far from unique or special. I'm a bit concerned at this point. No alcohol or spices are detectable. A clean inoffensive aroma of average strength.  T: Mango fruit, light pine, and some biting grapefruit citrus notes comprise the bulk of the hop profile. Pale malts, some caramalt, and a light doughy character provide the simple foundation. Lightly resinous. Hints of lime. Decently balanced, with a cohesive but not gestalt build.senses at different points in the structure. The bitterness/sweetness is off, but in different Very simple, lacking complexity, subtlety, nuance, and intricacy.  The doughy yeast character doesn't fit the clean feel you'd want in a good pale.

I'm not a big fan and I'm not sure what they're going for with this one.  Mf: Fairly clean. Crisp, smooth, and wet. Too filling for a pale ale. A bit too heavy on the palate, with too full a body. Doesn't suit the flavour profile or the style all that well. Unrefreshing. Overcarbonated.  Not oily, astringent, harsh, gushed, hot, rough, or boozy.  Dr: Nowhere near as drinkable as a pale ought to be, but fairly downable. I'm glad I just got a single; I wouldn't want another and wouldn't recommend this to friends.

      "Purchased today in my ongoing effort to try more beers by Bell's. Poured out of a 12oz bottle into a shaker pint glass. Bottled on \"07/08/13.\" Pours an amber golden color that's actually pretty hazy, as well as filled with light bubbles overall. A fizzy off-white head about a half finger tall lazily dies down to about nothing but a ring at the top of the glass. The carbonation goes pretty quickly as well. Not much lacing or viscosity on this. A simple, golden pale ale. Nothing more, nothing less. Smells of cracked barley flavors, dirty straw, light malted bitterness, and some floral hops at the finish. Ridiculously simple, almost to the point of feeling empty. Not fruity or sweet, or complex by any means. Only cracked toasted barley and light earthiness. I suppose this is supposed to be as simple as the style gets, but knowing its potential (as well as, *ahem*, Bell's potential), it could use some pruning. The flavor is awash with bittered cracked grainy flavors, light earthy hops, and slight notes of stale stonefruit. Nothing more comes in, other than a plain, barley predominant flavor that reminds me of stale toast and dry straw. There's a bit of a sweetness at the finish, but it doesn't do much else. Slightly thin in feel, and definitely not creamy or carbonated enough. Definitely simple, but not the most pleasing thing to sip on. Not much to say about this other than the fact that this is as basic as an APA can get. I do wish it didn't taste so barley forward and faded in terms of providing more complexity to the choppy bitterness, but it is what it is. I passed it over to someone else, but this could hit the spot if I needed something of its type. When, I've no clue, but it shall exist for that special point in time.\n",

      "This one is a hazy dark yellow, just a bit lighter than amber. On top rests an off-white head somewhere between one and two fingers tall with good retention. Lacing is deposited in thick patches and in pretty impressive density. Grassiness is big in the aroma, though some floral notes are part of that. There's a mineral edge that reminds me of particular English varietals, though I imagine that's just how it all plays together. There's a bit of sweetness lent from a citrus element and a pithy sort of dryness coming out with a note of rind.  Much the same can be said of the flavor with a few exceptions. This isn't an especially hoppy pale ale, but bitterness picks up in mostly floral and herbal notes. An underlying grains note remains stronger underneath, and a bit of peppery spice from the hops is also more noticeable. There's a touch more sweetness from notes of fruit. Crispness comes out strong right up front and stays strong. There's also a moderately smooth feel in the light-medium body. Carbonation may have a little too much bite to it, but it works together fairly well.\n",

A caramelized amber tone, it is sparklingly clear but can look rather brownish, especially away from the light. Its surface has as much head as the Gobi dessert does grass.  The yeast has more presence in the aroma than either the malts or hops - acceptable in Belgian offerings but disappointing in an American-style. I like floral and fruity qualities in these kinds of beers but this one has very little (if any) of those kinds of aromatics.  A bit of toffee is also noted, which, combined with the esters, reminds me of typical British ales. That impression is compounded in the mouthfeel as carbonate-rich water minerals make for a dry and chalky texture (especially in the finish once the caramelly sponge cake flavours fade).  The flavour also features a moderate level of fruitiness. This taste - primarily the product of yeast esters, though there's a trace of lemony citrus from the hops - is too vague to convincingly resemble any one thing and has an ambiguous orchard fruit character. The malts also have a very generic taste that isn't overly impressionable. Admittedly, how styles are defined and categorized can sometimes be rather subjective, but to brew a 'classic American Pale Ale' using German malt (Munich) and English hops (Goldings) isn't the way I'd go about it. This drinks so much like a British pale ale that it probably refers to soccer as 'football' and calls elevators 'lifts'.  Shiner Wild Hare Pale may, as the brewery advertises, have 'assertive aromas' and 'hoppy brightness' to drinkers that have only ever known commercial lagers. But anyone who's accustomed to truer, better brewed examples of the style will find it unsatisfying and lackluster. That was my impression anyhow. Not something I care to drink again.\n",

      "as a resident of los angeles with access to loads of west coast pale ales, my judgment of this texas brew may be biased. poured a coppery red tone with a smallish white head topping the glass. aromas threw me off - i get something of an estery, wheat-like nose coming off this one in addition to the caramel malts. label claims there is both \"assertive aromas\" and \"hoppy brightness\". the amlt characteristics are more prevalent than the US hop combination in my opinion. fruitier than i would have thought. i probably had built up in my mind a bit of an expectation for this beer, but it wasn't that great. the mirror pond i revisited in the store was better, but when in te-jas you gotta go with the local. nothing special here.\n",

      "So, the can says they \"slowly age it...\" yet the name says this beer is an ale. Maybe Yuengling takes an ale yeast, then \"lagers\" the beer before bottling? Cream ale, perhaps? Smells hoppy alright, but no sweetness noted. There's an ale yeast presence in the taste though this might be from the intense (and satisfying, oh yeah) carbonation. Mouthfeel is excellent especially when served from the can. Not to worry BA review police I did pour one into a glass in order to observe the ginger ale-esque color and head retention.  Is that cascades I detect in the taste as well? Fruity esters detected too, wtf. This is a strange beer to review, and its not much like the benchmark SNPA. Even my review is messed up. Oh well its about $15 cheaper per case than micro APA's, it fits the style category guidelines and tastes pretty good.\n",

S:Not a strong odor to it. Has a bit of a sharp fruity presence not there in the lager. More on that later. T:Good taste. Hops presence is immediately distinguishable along with some fruit undertones. A bit of sweetness on the tongue as well as a fair amount of bite. M:Not as oily as the lager. Not as pleasing as Bass. Sparkles on the tongue. Decent and average. Decent beer. Saw some of the reviews blasting it. Figured I would give it a try. It's not nearly as bad as some of the other beers I've tried in my life. And this is based on my experience with it in can form. Does it fare well against Dogfish? Of course not, you idiot. Is it a perfectly decent beer for a warm summer's evening? Yes. Is it cheap? Yes.

      "I got the 24-pack suitcase cans for a shade under $20 at Oliver's in Albany, NY. I'm trying to think of anything else that retails for about $5 a six-pack that has this much hop presence. The closest I can think of is Ballantine's, which gets all kinds of love here. The reviews and scores here here strike me as shockingly low, unless there's an extraordinary difference between the stuff sold in bottles and cans.  Pours a rich gold with a fluffy white head, like you'd expect from an APA. Smell is relatively mild, some inviting citrus notes; quite pleasant. Medium to thin body, by no means lacking in malt presence. The difference-maker is that unmistakeable hop top-note. Who cares if it's hop extract, the flavor is still there , it's very nice indeed, and it's consistent - you don't have to hunt for it. Finishes good and clean, no off-notes.  In short, no major flaws and a big, most welcome surprise in the upper-range of the palate. I only wish this stuff was sold in New England. Its competition at the price level would be Ballantine's, Labatt 50, Molson Export, and if you don't mind straying off-style, Michelob, Modelo and Schlitz Gusto. You can sometimes get Bass Ale on special for close to $10 for a 12-pack. Of that lot, the strongest contender might be the Ballantine. Sure, you could do better if you spent enough more, but that isn't the point. This is a most commendable effort from Yuengling.\n",

S - Light floral hops, sweet malts, caramel and corn syrup. Nothing to write home about. T - Adjuncts, yes, but also some pleasant floral hop notes and sweet caramel malt. Sweet corn too, but not too shabby on tap. M - Light bodied with a smooth, subtle syrupy texture with very mild bitterness on the palate.

      "Being from Indiana, I have this one from a tap fairly often. It looks a little more \"pale\" than many traditional pale ales, but pours pretty well with a nice head. Smells more on the grass/floral end than citrus, with balanced malt profile, but even from a tap (and having the brewery a short distance from my residence) its not much to write home about. Tastes like a lighter version of a pale ale with more of a hop bite. Thinner mouth feel than many other American pale ales.  Overall, its not my go-to Indiana beer by any means and I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to drink it if you live out-of-state BUT its a decent choice, especially for someone you want to ease into the world of microbrews with a mild hop presence. Side note: this beer is usually EXTREMELY overpriced in Indiana; recommend going to Sun King on their $6 growler fill day to get it, or else you will pay $14+ bucks a 4-pack.\n",

If I had a criticism it would be that it doesn't have a great finish like the very best in the category do. After having so many of the American IPA's I have concluded that is what separates the best....the finish. This is top 10...which is a huge accolade. These guys will get nation wide notoriety but they are not yet at the top of the class. This beer can hang with Sculpin! Yes...I said it, this can hang with Sculpin.

Rather than getting the fresh, juicy hops of the nose, they are overshadowed by a bitterness that just seems out of place. It's even spicy at times which is a complete departure from the aroma.

Slick and sticky, but the long-lasting bitterness lasts a while here too as well. D/O - Drinkability is moderate.

      "Spending some time in DC this summer and trying to get around some of the local brews. I picked this up along with a six of \"The Corruption,\" DC Brau's IPA. I don't ever really use my reviews to compare two beers, but this time it seemed really necessary. I feel that far too often, especially when trying out a new brewery, we (a lot of us anyway) skip right past their pale ale and reach for the IPA, figuring that it's a better flagship type representation of the brewery. This beer is right when that assumption could be wrong. When compared to their IPA, DC Brau is pulling off a lot more in my opinion with this beer. The Corruption is somewhat one dimensional, the malt doesn't seem to work with the hops as well (in that their overpowered), it's only .5% higher in ABV, yet the alcohol is perceived much more.  I actually think that this beer is underrated on here. This is one of the better, more complex pale ales I've had in a while. I'd drink this any day of the week. Both the malt and hops contribute to a bitter backbone that is balanced out by some floral almost honey caramel sweetness and a little grapefruit in the end.  I'll pick up more of this.\n",

Being a huge fan of pale ales of various varieties, found this to be a satisfying and semi Double/Imperial reminiscent pale ale. The alcohol content isn't really too heavy, nor is the hoppiness, but the hoppiness is quite nice. One can really get the caramel flavor from it, especially by tasting the head per se, upon first pouring it. The hop shell taste is quite good, and lingers with the sort of hints of caramel cirtusyness after one has a drink of the beer. The beer/ale overall isn't too heavy or syrupy per se, it has a nice sort of rich root-beer-ish color that is quite appealing, and overall I'd say that this is a great beer/ale.\n",

This retains with a ½ finger of creamy froth, leaving back sudsy lacing that sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma smells floral and piney in the nose, with an underlying mix of zesty grapefruit and more herbal feeling tones. A soft sweet graininess sits along the back. This has a nice fresh power to it in the nostrils.  The taste has a bright zesty citric bitterness to it, which is just cut short by a lightly toasted grainy sweetness from the malts. This does have a strong resinous presence to it though that lingers fairly aggressively in a dry and pithy feeling finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and crisp feeling on the tongue with more of a firm bubbly creaminess to the carbonation as it spreads out into the rest of the mouth. There is a LOT of slick oiliness here from those hops that really keep this smooth in the mouth.  This is a very solid take on an American APA with a good bit of aggressive hop character. Almost too much in spots (especially the pine) but I think that the overall balance and ease of the body are able to dial this back just enough and keep this solidly drinkable.

(4.5) Smell: This has some nice fruitiness - mostly tropical, but with a slight peppery edge as well. Maltiness appears as it opens up slightly, more focused on white bread and table sugar over caramel. Not bad at all - this beer seems like the archetypal new-school pale ale to me. (3.5) Taste: It opens up with nice malty flavors. Primarily white bread and crackers, but I'm also getting a little table sugar as well. Its hoppiness seems slightly spicy at first, only to gradually build a gentle tropical flavor on the back end. Not bitter at all, especially once the palate gets used to it. No surprises, just a delicious pale ale. (3.75) Mouthfeel: The feel seems almost full-bodied to me. Still, it's crisp and dry enough to help compensate. Carbonation is somewhat above average, helping the body go down easily. (4) Overall: This is the second Two Brothers beer that's impressed me. It doesn't quite blow me away, but that only means I'll gladly drink several in a session instead of just one. It also provides exactly what I want from a pale ale: great malt flavors, great hop flavors, impressive drinkability, and a relative richness.

      "The SideKick is a refreshing change up on an English classic. The SideKick has an English IPA base with subtle hop additive to make it real tasty. The beer pours a slightly hazy yellow with thin white head that is not leaving much of a lace. The smell is English bitter with a citrus backdrop. The taste is a light crisp refreshing bitter ale with a kick of citric punch. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with good carbonation. Over all this is an awsome session beer for the warmer days....especially.\n",

Taste - 4/5 Very nice and tasty citrus flavors, balanced with some good pine hops. Overall the bitterness is quite low, and the hops flavors are mellow and flavorful rather than biting. Not really that amazing, but still a decent PA. Mouthfeel - 4/5 Very crisp and fresh tasting. Medium bodied, and an average level of carbonation.

      "Thanks to NJB145 for this extra in a recent trade. Going light tonight after too much bourbon county last night...actually, not too much, just not enough food. I thought the mushroom burger was a burger with mushroom, not an actual mushroom burger, good, but not enough substance...but I digress. 12 oz. bottle, my first taste of Odd Side.  Pour is light orange with rollicking carbonation. First up the nose is pale malts, back up by pungent orange, sharp peach. Nothing demure about this pale up front.  CPA: Citra Pale Ale is like Seether's Careless Whisper: underneath, it's still a gussied-up pop song. Plenty of pale malt that's been upgraded with the much-advertised citra: those bitter oranges again, mixed with grapefruit guts, an almost wine-like sharpness, with an ending of karate-chop bitterness. Nicely oily. One &amp; done, but I won't complain while I'm drinking it.  Bit heavy on the bitterness without enough flavor to set it off: like an Al Sharpton loop. Not far from being something special, this one is just pretty good for me as is.\n",

      "12oz bottle, no bottling date, given to me by David. So probably about 3-4 weeks old at this point. Poured into a Surly Darkness goblet today, 11/1/2013. Pours a fairly dark amber body, dark for a pale ale, with a nice white head that slowly dissipates into a thick film on top. Looks good. Some lacing here and there, nothing special. Smells grapefruity balanced out by a biscuity and bready sweetness. Mostly grapefruits with a dab of pine. Kind of one dimensional.  Tastes grapefruity and dank, but a bit more biscuity and bready than I prefer. There isn't that juicy flavour that comes with Hill Farmstead pale ales or TG pseudoSue. This is closer to Zombie Dust than the others. This is kind of a fairly lesser executed Zombie Dust really. Medium bodied, resinous. A bit bitter on the back end with a bit of pine. No heat, pretty drinkable. Standard citra pale ale offering, comes nowhere near Zombie Dust or pseudoSue. Still, this is a great deal for the price and if you live in Michigan, this is a decent and reasonably priced substitute for when you're all out of Zombie Dust.\n",

Appearance: Poured a cloudy golden orange colour with a one finger white head that had good retention and nice stringy lacing. Aroma: Strong tropical fruits especially mango, pineapple and peach with hints of grass and citrus fruits like grapefruit and orange pulp. Taste: Hop-forward for sure, but very tea like at the same time. Its like a bitter and citrus (orange and lemon) tea with hints of bready malts. Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied with light carbonation (too light in my opinion). Overall: A great pale ale that is very easy to drink. It kind of reminds me a bit of tea and makes it interesting. The only thing is that I would have preferred more carbonation in it although this may take away the interesting tea like feel that I currently get.\n",

Served cold into a tulip at low altitude in Austin, TX and allowed to warm over the course of consumption. Served cold into a tulip and allowed to warm over the course of consumption. HEAD: White head dissipates within 15 seconds, leaving no lacing. BODY: Pretty standard copper with orange hues. Translucent. Nontransparent. Clean; no yeast particulate or hop sediment is visible. Appears well-carbonated. Not unique or special looking. AROMA: Resinous, floral hop character, pale malts, and some interesting oniony notes. Not piney, fruity, or juicy. No yeast character, alcohol, spice, or off-notes are detectable. Aromatic intensity is moderate. I'm not sure I really like the hop profile.  TASTE: Oniony, yes, but it kind of works. Has some floral hop character, but no juicy fruit, pine, or citrus. Not nectary. Pale malts provide the backbone. There's zero hop bitterness whatsoever, but while it's balanced in the sense that the malt sweetness checks the hop bitterness, the dominant oniony character isn't the right emphasis for a pale ale. No yeast character, alcohol, or off-notes come through. Above average depth of flavour. Average duration and intensity of flavour. This flavour profile is simple, but effective. Still, it lacks the intricacy/complexity and subtlety of superior beers in the style. I do like it, but I can't saw I'm blown away. TEXTURE: Smooth, wet, fairly refreshing, medium-bodied. Mild thickness. Slightly overcarbonated, but not too crisp or sharp. Not oily, gushed, hot, boozy, astringent, harsh, rough, or scratchy. This texture fails to elevate the beer, but does suit the taste nicely. Should be softer. OVERALL: Very drinkable, but not effortlessly so like the best beers in the style. It's nice work from Toppling Goliath, but isn't world-class. I'd probably buy it again if I saw it on shelves. A solid pale ale for its aims, but the onion emphasis does put me off a bit. Low B-\n",

They are so well balanced you could get in a ton of trouble with these! Overall: This is a top notch beer. I just hope I can get my hands on more in the future. The only downside I can say about these beers is that they do not have a bottling date and they do not have the abv. Clearly stated. Which is important, especially for those of us who are trading!

      "Picked up a bomber of the newly named Light Speed as soon as it hit Madison. Since we are fortunate enough to get Toppling Goliath here on a pretty regular basis, I was able to have Light Speed along side PseudoSue which to me, is the gold standard of pale ales. Light Speed smelled wonderful but the taste lacked a little pop. It was very crisp and clean as all Toppling Goliath brews are but I was left wanting slightly more especially when compared to Sue. The day after having the bomber of Light Speed, I was able to have a dry-hopped firkin version at the brewery and that was much more flavorful. Nonetheless, this beer was still better than most despite not being my favorite from Toppling Goliath.\n",

      "This one was had on tap at Blackstone.  Appearance- The beer comes at me a beautiful cloudy and bright gold body with a half finger of sticky, bone-white head. Smell- A general hop citrus scent comes out of the nose. It is mostly oranges. Also a smooth and sweet biscuit malt coming through. Could that also be some floral hops I'm smelling too? Taste- Wow the hops! Not an IPA? Really? They are extremely fresh and citrus like, especially catching lemon in there. Not really as much oranges as in the nose, a bit of grapefruit. What is really nice is the finish has a great base of caramel or biscuit malt that really does a wonderful job of smoothing the drink out. It makes it hard to not immediately follow up with another drink.  MF- A great medium body and a lot of carbonation is noticeable. It comes off slightly dry, but it still fills the mouth and remains relatively smooth. Overall- I really am not surprised Toppling Goliath has made another incredibly easy to drink beer with their distinct reliance on citrus hops. I was impressed with the amount of lace left on the pint glass after I was finished. Hopefully this beer becomes a regular with the group over at Toppling Goliath. The tap handle even impressed me with it's distinctive Star Wars style font and starry deep space background. She's got it where it counts.\n",

Smell - Crackery malt aroma with hints of biscuit and a slightly floral and grassy hop bitterness sitting beneath. Taste - Follows the nose. Real plain bready malt base with notes of floral hops coming in by mid-taste, then quickly ramping up to deliver a bitter, grassy finish. Mouthfeel - Light-to-medium in body with fair, bitey carbonation. Slick texture with a slightly watery but also slightly harsh finish, if that makes sense.  Overall - Wow, this thing's a relic.

A tribute to the Great Lakes, T.C.B. is a truly quaffable beer.\" Brewed in the style of an American Blonde Ale. Available as a year round offering in 6 packs and on draft. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a pint glass. Served above 49 degrees Fahrenheit. (Appearance) Pours an off-white head of a frothy foam consistency over a medium hazy golden yellow body with light peppered sediment in tow, light carbonation. Retention is very good, lacing is light and spotty. 4.25 (Smell) Cracker and fluffy wheat malts with a touch of earthy and herbal hops. Somewhat peppery, softly tart. Smells right on par for an American Blonde for lightness but I like the depth of the malt profile which constantly keeps me guessing as to all that went into it. Potency is medium. 3.75 (Taste) Flavor is much like the aroma predicted, slightly less sweet and lighter. Earthy, cracker and biscuity malt notes intertwined with a faint grassy and fruity hop with a soft bitterness. A bit doughy, grainy fruity and peppery altogether. As far as it falls along the style, it's one of the more flavorful blonde ales. 3.75 (Mouthfeel) Texture is smooth, lightly peppery, medium dry. Carbonation is moderate, creating a frothy, smoothly crisp mouthfeel. Body is medium+ for the style, light/medium overall. Balance is very slightly bitter over sweet. Alcohol presence is low, off characters are minimal. 3.75 (Overall) I had great concerns opening a beer that I stumbled upon in a loose bottles clearance bin, especially alongside others brewed in 2009. I'd never even seen this beer before. I was very surprised to find that it had either been cellared beautifully or just managed to hold up gracefully well over the past few years.

This hopped up session ale is specially formulated to accompany you on all of your outdoors activities. Pack in this flavorful ale and pack out the memories while enjoying this quaffable brew.” Brewed in the style of an American Pale Ale. Terrapin's very first can offering and their fifth year round beer, first released in June 2013. A representative from the company informed me that this is a hopped-up version of the 2012 Summer seasonal \"Easy Rider\" which has since not returned. Poured from a 12 oz. can to a Terrapin pint glass. Served north of º Fahrenheit. (Appearance) Pours a creamy froth head of a gold white tone, very sudsy. Body color is a medium hazy golden amber with mild carbonation and thin sediment in tow. Retention is average, with sudsy lacing speckling the edge of the glass. 3.5 (Smell) Aromas of floral, citrusy grapefruit and resinous hops over a toasted caramel, bready rye and peppery malt background. Balance is nice, although the hop aroma does carry the most weight in the aroma. This is a very complex and aromatic beer, especially for a sessionable ale. Potency is high. 4 (Taste) Up front, a very peppery biscuit malt with a dry pale malt base follows with a hop bouquet touting a moderate earthy bitterness. Sweetness seem to be in short supply in the flavor, likely to keep this beer as sessionable and light drinking as possible, but the hop presence and bitterness is quite strong in this beer, with a very herbal, floral and spicy hop profile. The malt and hop flavor isn’t quite as bright, complex and varied as it was in the aroma. 3.75 (Mouthfeel) Texture is slick and mildly dry with a subtle chalkiness. Carbonation is rather low in this beer- I don’t know why, as this would be a great beer with a moderate crisp carbonation in tow. Body is medium/high for the style, medium overall. Alcohol presence is light, really well concealed in the flavor of this beer. 3.75 (Overall) Terrapin’s RecreationAle lays out some serious flavor despite a low gravity and mellow malt sweetness in tow. There’s a great deal of specialty malt and hop character to savor in this beer. A suitable candidate for a session ale, ideally for the “hoptimally” challenged. This beer can be enjoyed through multiple repeats with the added benefit of a deep flavor profile without wrenching sweetness. Score one solid beer for high blood sugar patients! 3.75 Terrapin Beer Company’s Terrapin RecreationAle 3.79/5.00\n",

Taste is of a british pale ale, slightly bready with a little smoke. has a clear and refreshing backbone.  i could appreciate the craft of this brew, however for the price i can think of 10,000 brews i'd rather drink. nothing special here, an average beer at best\n",

      "Had this for the first time at a restaurant in Milton, DE...about a mile from the brewery. Sorry to say this was the only DFH brew thay had on tap. I'm actually more of a fan of their IPA's and stronger brews but I figured I'd give it a try. A - Golden color...no where as dark as their IPA 60 or 90. When I got it, very little head was left but the waitress was busy so maybe it had time to settle before I received it. Did leave a slight lacing on the glass when completed. S - Nothing special...no overwhelming smells (again based on my experienced with their other beers) T - Taste was actually good. A LOT DIFFERENT from other DFH beers I've had. Very light tasting but with a nice smooth finish. M - Had a lot of carbonation...again I don't know if this was due to it being on tap rather than a bottle. D - Man, you could easily down several of these with no problem. Unlike other DFH brews with high ABV's, this beer IMHO is made for the average joe beer drinker who is used to a lighter, massed produced beer. The advantage here is that is from DFH so the overall quality is much better. A session beer for sure. My overall impression: A good beer but not something I'll be replacing my IPA 60 or 90 with. Hopheads be warned...this is not like other offerings from DFH. That's not a bad thing..It's just seems like an average offering from my favorite brewery.\n",

I went to the lcoal beer store and they said they had a new Dogfish Head APA so I bought a case, totally forgetting the name of the same beer I'd had on-tap 4 days earlier! A= tin-yellow, good head, nice rimming, tons or lacing. S= sweet malts, zplendid hops, honey, rather nice for a creative stock APA. In some ways, though, it's too golden for an APA and would be better with slightly less sweetness. T= plenty of malt richness, more toward a golden APA for Dogfish Head, slightly thick, touch of honey, rich malts with balanced hops florals and bitterness. M= lightly golden honey traits protruding through the nice rich malts and dry grassy bitters. D= very drinkable with most anything that would go with golden lager, golden ale and or a rich malts APA. HOWEVER -- Start with this beer, first. If you drink a more hoppy-beer (especially an IPA) this one will taste overly-honey golden and otherwise rather flat and unappealing.\n",

There are notes of caramel and molasses. There is a slight metallic note and no hop/citrus smell which is the norm in DFH 60/90.  T: I love most DFH beers, and while this is not one of my favorites, it is serviceable. It is an easy go to beer when I am at the brewpub and don't feel like anything heavier or high in abv. You can taste the caramel malt the entire time, and especially on the back end.  M/D: Its pretty easy drinking, but I would say its a little heavier than a typical pale ale. It does not have a lot of carbonation. It is certainly a a gateway beer into the world of DFH and what I would give to someone who usually drinks BMC.\n",

Not picking up a ton of hops. T: Just what the smell indicated, but the buttery/sour, malty taste is too much for me. It's not bad, but I feel like it's not balanced enough. M: Medium, but on the verge of light, slighty watery. Also a bit too much carbonation. D: I'm a big fan of DFH, but this is definitely my least favorite.

Pleasant malt sweetness that hints at tangerine. the spruce flavor is just wonderful here, it delivers in a wonderful way, more spruce beer please. some pepper notes too M: a little too full without being sticky or resinous, which would have done it for me. O: Love it, another home run for dogfish head, makes me want to do a spruce tip beer.

      "I picked up a six of Sierra Nevada's Sidecar Orange Pale Ale at Meijers Last week. I bought a six pack a month ago and it ended up being recalled, so now that a new batch showed up I thought it would I would give it another try, so lets see how it goes. 2017 Vintage. Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a imperial pint glass.  A- The label looks nice, it goes well with the name and it's a little eye catching. It poured a darker orange color which took on more of a golden orange color when held to the light and ti had two fingers worth of fluffy off white head that died down to a thin ring that eventually faded away and it left some spotty lacing behind. This is a pretty nice looking beer, I have no complaints.  S- The aroma starts off with a slightly higher amount of medium sweetness with the orange being the first to show and it impart a big citrus and orange aroma that's a little juicy and it's the aroma that shows up the most in this beer. Up next come a slight bit of doughy yeast that and that leads into the malts which impart some pale malt, light bread and light grainy aromas with some sweet malts showing up in the background. Towards the end comes the hops which are a little on the lighter side and impart a light spicy, light floral and light green hop like aromas. This beer has a good aroma, it really lives up to it's name.  T- The taste seems to be very similar to the aroma and it starts off with a slightly higher amount of medium sweetness with the oranges still being the first to show up and they still stick out the most in this beer while imparting all those same nice orange aspects that it did in the aroma. Up next comes the doughy yeast which is barely noticeable and that goes into the hops which impart all the same aspects that they did in the aroma and they are just as light. Towards the end comes the malts which are just a little lighter than they were in the aroma and it's the pale and sweet malts that seem to stick out the most. On the finish there's a lighter amount of medium bitterness with a nice orange and light hoppy aftertaste. This is a pretty nice tasting beer, the orange is very dominant and the malts and hops show up just enough to remind me that it's still a Pale and not shandy.  M- Smooth, refreshing, a little crisp, medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. The mouthfeel is pretty nice and it works well with this beer.  Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and it's a solid example of the style, I like it, but to me it came very close to being like an orange shandy and I think if the malts and hops showed up just a little less it would would pretty much be a shandy, so I think it's teetering on the edge. This beer had nice drinkability, I could drink a few of these, especially when it's hot out. What I like the most about this beer is the aroma, it's very nice and it seems to have a little better balance than the taste. What I like the least about this beer is that it wasn't just a little more balance, it's pretty close to shandy territory. I would buy this beer again in the summer time and I would recommend to anyone looking for a beer with strong orange flavors. All in all I liked this beer and I thought it was solid, the balanced could be worked on and it could be better, but as it stands now it's solid. It's not a favorite Sierra Nevada beer and it's a solid example of the style. Nice job guys, this beer really delivers on the oranges, keep it up.\n",

FEEL: Light bodied, well carbonated, even finish, clean, it is what it should be. OVERALL: A great tasting pale ale from Uinta brewing.

      "Clearly labeled best by 6/27/14. Found this one in a dollar bin. Appearance: Semi-translucent and probably would have been clear without the bit of sediment that came near the end of the pour, as is usual with unfiltered beer. Copper in color with a thin film of off-white foam and some lacing. Aroma: Caramel malt dunked in orange, but lacking sweetness. Some bread, possibly yeast esters. Taste: Immense bitterness right from the get-go. A bit of spicy/earthy hop flavor behind 30 IBUs that pack a serious punch. At 5.2% ABV and given how hop-dominated the flavor is, there really isn't any malt presence. The finish is smoother than I expected. By that point the bitterness has dropped off a bit and by the aftertaste it ebbs to a level that is easily manageable. There is a slight sweet orange flavor at times that I imagine is much more present in a fresh bottle. Definitely lives up to its name. Mouthfeel: About medium, which is heavy for a 5.2% ABV beer so the malt is there, more so than in the flavor department. Good drinkability despite the ferocious bitterness. Sessionable is you are looking to give your palate a good thrashing. It would be difficult to follow this one up with anything lighter or less hoppy. A bit aggressive on the carbonation but nothing a good swirl can't remedy. Final Thoughts: Quite enjoyable for a beer over a month past its best by date. Highly recommend for those who seek the most bitter beers while maintaining a need for a lower ABV. I especially appreciate the description on the label, \"At the end of every glass you will discover how this pale ale got its name.\" And indeed that rings true. Would I drink it again? Yes.\n",

Flavors are similar, caramel malt is a little tired out, mild to moderate bitterness after a bigger sip. Light to medium bodied, average carbonation, lingering grassy bitterness in the aftertaste.

T- The most dominate flavor is definitely malts, slightly sweet caramel, a little bit of hops, definitely a bitter and slightly sweet/tangy finish (hence the name). M- Medium bodied, slightly creamy, a little bit above average carbonation, goes down smoothly. O- I thought this was a good pale ale that is a little bit different then your average pale ale.

The taste holds notes of bitter orange rind, light caramel, light buttery biscuit, and what seems like some peppery rye bread in there as well.

      "Bought this single 12oz brown bottle at Trader Joe's in Glen Ellyn, IL for $1.42. (They let you break apart 6 packs there and then charge you 1/6 of the 6 pack price for a single bottle.) The back label has a blurb about the brewery on it along with a clearly marked freshness date of March 22, 2010. The beer pours a rich, deep, dark golden color, but when held up to light it turned a bright yellow. The beer made a 1½ finger white head that lasted several minutes and left a good amount of lacing. The smell is weak - just a touch of floral, citrus, and piny hops. The three hop varieties in here really dominate the taste. There is definitely a sweet malty presence, but it hardly makes a dent into the hop bitterness. Forget about balance - this is a hop lover's delight. I loved the resulting bitter flavor created from mixing the floral, citrus, and piny hops. The beer is medium bodied, smooth, and heavily carbonated, giving it a spritzy mouthfeel. Drinkability will depend on how well you like bitter beers. If you're a big fan of IPA's and APA's, then you'll find this to be a very good one and I could drink a whole bunch of them - especially with its low 5.1% abv, but if you're not a fan of bitter beers, you might want to leave this one on the shelf.\n",

The head starts off just shy of a finger's worth and thins from there. Thin layer of retention with a clumpy ring and good lace. Tart lemon juice notes are interjected into aromas of orange pith and grass. The lemon aspect is definitely grabbing. Biscuit malts and a hint of toasty bread linger underneath.  The flavors are comparably bright, though the citrus notes are not at the fore. Instead, there is a lofty grassy presence and some floral notions. Tangy citric tones move in from the edges. Toasted bread rounds it out. Maybe a scratch or two of pine in there. It definitely has a nice hop kick to it. The feel is somewhere between light to medium body, probably leaning more toward the former. Carbonation is ample but never seems to over shoot the feel of the beer.

Appearance: An inch of thick, off-white fluff sits atop a lightly hazed, golden body. Head retention proved to be pretty spectacular, and the lacing looked great to boot: sticky, cobweb-like lace all the way down. Smell: Mango, pineapple, and tangerine all come to mind immediately; this has a really floral, fruity nose. Dry pine, dirt, and faint caramel play secondary roles. I don't think I've ever detected so much late-addition hopping in a pale. Taste: Pine resin and caramel are easy to pick out, and the same goes for pineapple. Tangy citrus and bread dough are more subtle. Bitterness is off the charts for a pale: strong and lingering; I'd assume this is right around 60 IBUs. Mouthfeel: Full-bodied, aggressively bitter, and prickly with tons of mouth coating. Moderate carbonation. Feels a lot more like an IPA - very similar to GF West Coast IPA, in fact - than a pale ale. Overall: If you like Green Flash's West Coast IPA, you'll love this one - it seemed like the same beer with extra late hop additions.

Pungent and powerful citrus aroma and somewhat sweet, especially for a pale ale. Some pine as well. Citrus and hop bitterness along with a distinct pine bite. Very flavorful.  Medium mouthfeel.

Somehow, I have not reviewed this beer yet, even though I've lived in the area for several years now. This beer pours a hazy (possibly chill haze, it's really cold) goldenhue that shows off light carbonation and is topped with a light, frothy, bright white head that dissipates to a rocky layer with a neck (nice and slow dissipation). 4/5 The aroma is definitely hop focuses with a good amount of citrus going on in the form of grapefruit and lemon peel, as well as a good dose of pine to back things up. The malt is pretty well hidden here and doesn't provide much aroma. 3.75/5 The flavor profile is slightly malty up front with a bready sweetness but this gives way to grapefruit and lemon peel quite quickly, and then transitions to the pine resin to finish things off. This is a very simple flavor profile but it is well executed and flavorful. It is not overly bitter with only moderate bitterness and only lightly lingering bitterness. 4.25/5 This is a light bodied pale ale that is crisp, clean, moderately drying with light lingering dryness, and it sports light carbonation. The carbonation comes off as a slight tickle up front and then dissipates to nothing. 3.75/5 This is a flavorful pale ale that borderlines on sessionable.

The bread malt switches over to a sweeter caramel malt in the finish and the hops begin to make their presence known as well. The hops have a weird mixture of citrus, earthy, and pine characteristics that make for an odd lingering, but mild bitterness finish. Feel- Medium feel, medium carbonation, and minimal lingering sweetness in the finish. Overall- Nothing really special about this pale ale, and overall is pretty boring. Not even something that I'd be willing to consider as a casual go to beer. The malt flavors are solid and remind me of Sierra Nevada's pale ale, however, the hops make for an odd lingering finish.

Frumpy, off white head is one plus inches with a strong hold factor. High amount of lace coverage smothers the vessel.  S: Sweet peach and apricot aroma is first on the nose. Pale grain backing with a fresh orange slices coming through. Strength is medium per style, with a moderate rate of retention.  T: Citrusy bitterness for the flavor is bold and upfront, flowery in nature, with some supporting cast of melon and grapefruit notes. Ctironella, lemony flair mingles with some alcohol. The hopping rate is fairly high high, bittering, less fruity and sweet then the nose. Crisp and pale malting with hints of grassiness and a warming of lemony-tropical alcohol comes on the finish.  M: Crisp, carbonation, aggressive around the tongues edges, medium bodied with a slippery texture.  O: Sweet nose, nice dose of fresh citra notes, the flavor is more dry hopping, but is very crisp and sharp in drinkability.

The malt is very light and the hops are the main flavor with juicy quality with the aroma sending you back to the tropical and citrus in the taste with each sip.

Hoppy flavor with notes of grapefruit, resin, lemongrass, passion fruit, a bit of toasted malts and muffled caramel, spices, American yeast, pine, green mango, green pears, melon, pineapple core, grass and lime. Dry aftertaste with a rounded but long lasting bitterness. It sure feels bitter than its 45 IBUs, especially considering its body, nothing wasted here. Passed the sneeze test. Bordering medium body with appropriate carbonation. Alcohol of 7% abv is well hidden. Beefed up APA with good fruit complexity. Really a well done citrus bomb, balanced and intense but not harsh. Also with a superb real passion fruit assertive nose. If it was easily available, this would certainly a regular. Resist well over time, no lame excuses for being extra fresh.\n",

      "This was one of the many beers poured at the December Albany Taproom bottle share. Not sure who brought this, but thanks! Poured out of a 22oz bottle into a tulip glass. Bottling date is unfortunately forgotten, but I do remember this being between 3-4 weeks old. Pours a sunset orange amber color with a fizzy off-white head that rises about a finger high before pathetically dying down within a few minutes. Slightly cloudy, but overall looks like a modest, simple pale ale of a beer. It does retain some oily qualities, as well as some slight sticky lacing at the sides of the glass, which is slightly appealing. Not the most life changing looking beer of its kind, but it does have some charm. I wish I could say the same for the aroma, however! This starts off fine, with some strong pine, grapefruit, pineapple, and passion fruit. Other light tropical notes predominate, but it's a little too faded to make out. Then, the flavor nosedives into a cooked malty, buttery texture that is distracting from the actual hop and malt profile that the brewery perhaps intended. Contains some brief vegetal green pepper notes, as well as light garlic cloves. This is common (at times) with Citra, but I believe something is a bit off here. Is it a diacetyl issue? Is the yeast slightly temperamental? No clue, but this is super citrusy, Cascade-like fruit notes that I typically don't go after Citra hopped beers to try, and it lacks a charming sweetness to back it up. Disjointed. The aroma was a bit off, but the flavor may be even worse. Other than the brief tropical notes, as well as the onion/garlic savory combo that I picked up in the aroma, this displays mainly nothing but grapefruit, orange rinds, and pine. Normally, and especially when consuming a beer this young, this would be that much of big deal, but then the buttery texture returns in the aftertaste - with a vengeance. This is definitely plagued by diacetyl issues, and it suffers for it. The hops do nothing to cover it up, and the lightly sweetened, seemingly brittle malt profile doesn't back it up either. Luckily, there's no serious acidic or astringent issues at play, and the yeast seems to be what's holding everything together, but this is one step away from falling apart. This is pretty well carbonated, however, and it was relatively easy to drink. Not the worst, but very forgettable. This is made from the same guys that brought Simtra to the table? Man, what a shame. Even if they had solved those buttery issues in the beer, it would have done nothing to completely save it from faded citrus and sweet malt qualities that are plaguing this beer. I know there's a great pale ale in here somewhere, but there's just not much to work with. Having this after a good amount of exposure to Zombie Dust really shows you that these kinds of beers aren't easy to make. Hopefully future experiments from the brewery will be progressively more palatable and stable.\n",

Not overly heavy, but maybe a bit bigger than in the extra pale ale's I prefer. Certainly doesn't deliver the massive hoppiness of some XPA's like Bruery, Jupiter, Drake's etc. . . maybe a lighter body and bolder use of the citra hop (like in Simtra) would allow this beer to shine even more, but as it is, its still a decent option, especially to smell moreso than taste.\n",

Leaves some nice lacing as well, pretty good looking beer. Nose is pretty faint, but what is there is pretty nice. Fresh, mildly minty hops with a hint of lemongrass. Malts are pretty neutral and only contributes a touch of graininess. Steel Rail EPA has a very fresh taste with a nice dose of both flavoring and bittering hops. A bit of both the mint leaves and lemon peel noticed on the nose come through in the tasting as well. Malts stay in the background for the most part but do contribute a biscuit and light toasty aspect. Not much of a wow factor for this one, but would make an ok summer sessioner. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side, but that is to be expected with a grain bill this light, I would not be surprised if zero specialty malts were used.

      "Bottled on 8/25/15, poured into my fancy Duvil tulip: Look: It's copper, it's clear, and there's a white &amp; frothy two-finger head on top.  Smell: Somewhat muted, but there's some lemon and floral aromas going on. They're not exactly jumping out of the glass, but they're there if you jam you're nose right in. Taste: Mmmmm, dankness! Delicious pine, floral, tangerine, grapefruit pith, and herbal flavors. It definitely tastes better as it warms up. It's well-crafted and relatively balanced. I'm especially loving the bitter citrusy/piney finish, reminds me of Moxie. Well done, Otter Creek! Resinous and slick, but it's easy to have more than one. Feel: Medium-bodied with medium+ carbonation. Lovely prickly pine finish.  Overall: I'm really enjoying this beer. It's easy to acquire and definitely delivers on its price of admission.\n",

Poured from the 12 oz. bottle into a Lawson's tulip. a: Nearly clear gold with an inch tall white head which receded to even surface foam and fairly dense lacing. s: Mild light fruit,. t: Light fruit accompanied by a lot of bitter hop bite. Bitterness lingers. Some dankness develops in aroma and taste later. m: Medium, good body, pretty heavy carbonation tingle. o: The latest in the OC VW Bus series showcasing brewer Mike Gerhart's skills with hoppy brews. This one is a solid session American Pale at 55 IBUs and 5.5 ABV. I wonder if the fact this is the fifth in the series has anything to do with all the 5s. UPDATE 6/19/15: bought a sixpack bottled last November on sale for $6 and had one. Holds up well, and although the light fruit notes are largely absent now, it's still a tasty, refreshing and satisfying brew, especially notable at its session level ABV.\n",

Head retains well and leaves some very nice lacing. S: Citrusy fruit aromas of orange peel, and apricot. Also is very herbal hop forward with grassy, and pine like hops. There is a slightly honey sweet aroma as well. Pretty dank with lots of hops, smells closer to an IPA. T: Flavors of citrus, orange and grapefruit mostly. Then some herbal spice, sweet malts, and lots of pine like hops. Has a lot of bitterness to it and is not as balanced as you would hope for a Pale Ale. Much like the nose suggests closer to an IPA. M: Light bodied, with a moderately high amount of carbonation. Slick and slightly oily. Has a lingering bitterness and finishes hop heavy.  O: Not a bad brew by any means but not anything special.

Some floral notes and quite a bit of citrus in the aroma and flavor from the hops but the character some describe as \"onion-like\" from Summit hops adds a special sharpness, vibrancy, and crispness to the hop flavors that I love. Additions of some moderately toasted malts to the grain bill adds an extra dimension to the flavor which keeps the beer interesting. Alcohol is low enough and the beer is dry enough to provide for a high level of drink-ability.\n",

Clean, light more than medium, bone dry, slight cling.  Willamettes, Cascades, CTZ and Summits Some fruit, some juice, but ultimately a clobberingly (for the strength, and for 45 IBUs too, actually) bitter citrus fest. In a way it’s a minor miracle that they managed to pack this amount of hops into a 5-ish% beer, and if I were looked for a true IPA at low ABV, this would be it. But at the same time, if I’m looking for 5% beer, do I want something this harsh? Doesn’t show the deft balance of Let It Ride, and so is a bit of a letdown (especially after that nose) that way.  An IPA in APA's clothing.\n",

      "Gotta thank Todd in bringing over this plus Surly offerings from Minneapolis this week while I'm semi-stranded in Indiana. Poured out of a 12oz can into a pint glass. No freshness date. Pours a golden pale color with a little amount of frothy white head that, while not very large, sticks around for a surprisingly good long while. Carbonation is quite good and lots of bubbles make themselves present. Slightly sticky and bready looking. Very simple, but quite appealing. The aroma is a cascade of citrus focused hops, providing lots of fruitiness and slight earthiness at the finish. Orange peel, lemon peel, grapefruit peel, and dried apricots and pine needles. All of the fruits do not smell juicy, but rather dry and zesty, to refreshing and breezy results. There's a cracked barley flavor that resmbles sugar cane and light toffee. Not super present or anything flavor-wise, but it's delightful. The flavor is, on the other hand, a burst of fresh squeezed citrus fruits combined with a bready and earthy sweetness. After every sip, this tasted the equivalent of fresh squeezed grapefruit or orange juice, with the same soured and citrusy properties, as well as the same dry finish and fruity aftertaste. The malts provide notes of light honey and bready sweetness, with earthy golden cereal grains that provide a backbone for the initial zest. Very, very flavorful stuff, and with the well carbonated and creamy feel, this is fantastically refreshing. As far as session pale ales go in this country, this is excellent stuff. Very zesty, flavorful, and the feel similar to fresh squeezed juice is astonishing, especially considering the number of IBUs on this. I want to see more beers like this to fill up my fridge. Highly recommended a try for those with wrecked palates from hoppier offerings at this point.\n",

The taste is almost pure hops. Mild malty backbone to give the hops some sweetness. Big hoppy bite with more citrus than the nose. A bit of onion from the hops, but not a lot. Getting mostly grapefruit, especially at the end. More IPA than pale ale. Crisp, bitter and smooth. Lighter end of medium body, soft carbonation. A west coast pale ale that I am having trouble separating from a west coast IPA. So hoppy and good, who cares. Easily the hoppiest pale ale I've had. Terrific beer from a terrific local brewery.\n",

      "The beer looks like it first went through the toaster and then was frozen; its orange colour is crispy and heated but its complexion is chilly and icy. That haze does little to hinder the bright shimmer but adds apparent texture to it. The bubbles, meanwhile, aloofly flutter about; their obvious apathy leads to a head that is dopey and limp (and wouldn't last).  What makes a beer \"American\"? For starters, a lot of hops. In that regard, this does indeed smell \"American\". It has traces of pine serum and pink grapefruit, both lathered in a gooey caramel coating. A strong impression of toasted malts mellows out much of the citric and piny characteristics of the hops but they manage quite capably to be noticed nevertheless. What else makes a beer \"American\"? How about a brazen, brassy attitude. A beer that doesn't tickle the taste buds but smack them upside the head. The kind of beer that doesn't turn its music's deafening bass down when it stops at a red light. The kind of beer that radiates confidence in everything it does. Indeed, this makes concessions for no one.  Especially not those drinkers who are put-off by too much bitterness, flavour or character in their beers. A lot of people think of American beer as watery, insipid swill - Stoudts American Pale with its firm, chunky toasty maltiness, underlying caramel sweetness and the stinging, citric hops is the nemesis to all that. And the enemy to mine enemy is my friend.  This kind of jazzy, hoppy, confident ale is emblematic of how the Americans like to brew their beers. In fact, it's so American that it hates the French. All this assertive, self-assured flavour is exactly why American beer is so charming, and this level of quality and craftsmanship is exactly why its microbreweries have been so successful.\n",

Pours crystal clear bright copper color, a bit on the light side, with a fantastic two-finger off-white head that has great retention and leaves fantastic lacing. Could do with just a bit of haze in my book, but an excellent-looking beer any way you look at it.  Nose has a nice, bready caramel sweetness to it complemented by a light citrusy hop nose, a bit soapy. Very restrained.  Taste is remarkably clean, no real bite to it at all. Hops come off as soapy, especially as the beer warms, a bit of citrus underneath, very mild bitterness, over a pale malt sweetness that's light and a bit grainy. Rather off-putting soapiness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy even, with a smooth carbonation. A bit astringent and drying towards the finish.  Drinkability is hurt primarily by the odd hop character. May have to check the bottle to find out when this one came in, though Stoudt's haven't been in the TN market really long enough for their beer to have already gone bad, unless it came in already old. May have to investigate.\n",

Pours a fairly clear, light golden orange with a thick white head that leaves good lacing and a small cap fed by some stray bubbles from the bottom. The aroma is light and sweet with as much malt sweetness as hops. There are some faint grassy aromas but the sweet caramel and biscuity malts are dominant in the nose. The taste has lemon grass up front but, like the aroma, those hops are secondary to the bready malts. The finish is like dry toast with some bitterness from the hops lingering as well.

Flavor is a nice blend of crystal and pale malts and citrus and pine flavored hops. The bitterness is off, which I suspect is a water issue. If the water source is high in certain salts such as bicarbonates, the bitterness of the hops comes off soapy, alkaline and medicinal. Mouthfeel is thin. Overall, it seems to be a good recipe, just needs a mineral adjustment. Or not. I could be wrong. Either way, it's been my experience as a home brewer that water can greatly affect hop perception.

Aroma is malt forward, biscuit, and molasses, with some fruits (apricot, peach.) Surprisingly little hop presence. Taste comes in with biscuit-y malts and fruit sweetness, mostly apricot. Bitterness very gradually follows, mostly of a grassy, herbal and spicy nature, leading to a bitter but not terribly dry finish. Mouth feel is medium, smooth, and fairly well carbonated. A 6.0% ABV makes this one drinkable while not being insubstantial. This one threw me a sight curveball. One might go into an American Pale Ale with certain expectations; mostly bright citric hops, piney bitterness, and a fairly dry finish. This however has none of those to my palate... it felt much more like an old world pale ale, especially in the way it presets it's spicy Bavarian hops over a bed of robust malt. Indeed, it reminded me somewhat of Bass Ale from back in the days before A-B Inbev started brewing it in the States and ruined it. I don't recall ever having tried the original iteration of this, so I can't base a comparison vs that, and I do feel that this one is going to confuse a few drinkers.

While it is bitter, the aroma and taste tend much more towards maltiness than hoppiness. Not necessarily a bad thing, buts it's definitely not your standard pale ale.

Stone Pale Ale 2.0 is deeply and elegantly balanced - as arrogantly balanced as Arrogant Bastard, but subtly great. Perhaps subtle ale is the ultimate arrogance. Perhaps I underrate this beer and Boston Lager, the champions of subtle balance. Probably, but my limitations are my own. The color is deep amber. The head is beautifully white, showing off with abundant foam and lacing. The aroma is German. These hops know where they are from. The delightful Bavarian hops and ale yeast create a delightful, deep ale aroma. The malt is there, in the background. It's not a malt-forward lager. It's an ale. The taste is pure, beautiful, deep, German ale. Yet, the Germans do lagers, especially pilsners, while my UK forebears love them some ale. Stone has broken down the cultural walls of Europe with a pure California Eff it. He!! Yeah. It rocks. Deep and beautiful. Give it time, hard-core IPA drinkers. It's beautiful. The feel is medium- perfect. Stone doesn't do water. Leave that to Inbev. This is a full-bodied, great ale. Overall, this it's the best pale ale I have ever had.

I previously ranted about how Ruination 2.0 was a pointless, unnecessary effort because Stone created a beer that did not significantly improve upon its (quite lovely) predecessor.

      "have been hitting it hard for the #OktoberfestChallenge2016 but the ones that I have remaining are ones that I have not previously reviewed, making them excellent candidates for tomorrow, New Beer Sunday (Week 609). In the interim, I will peer into the depths of my reefer and see what awaits my attention. I seem to have strayed back into the realm of bottles. Oh, well.  From the bottle: \"Experimental Pale Ale\"; \"Family &amp; Employee Owned Since 1988\"; \"Profile - floral and tropical notes, perfectly balanced.\"; \"Bottle Conditioned for Quality [-] Live yeast added to the bottle allows this beer to age gracefully and stay fresher, longer. Keep bottles upright, and away from light &amp; heat.\" I will readily cop to having an old bottle (Best By: 05/24/16), but the fact that it is bottle-conditioned leads me to want to see what has happened in the interim, especially since they have released another XPA in this series. I initially had it in my crowded reefer on its side until I pulled it out &amp; noticed a lot of floaties. I then stood it upright, put it back into the reefer and after several hours of calming time, I performed a gentle pour into a schooner glass. An in-glass swirl raised a finger of foamy, tawny head with modest retention. Color was Deep Amber/Light Copper to Copper (SRM = &gt; 13, &lt; 17) with NE-plus clarity of which others might be envious. Nose had a tropical fruitiness that had not given up. It was like a fruit basket filled with mango, guava, papaya &amp; honeydew. What a bright, mellow beer this has become! I was put in mind of drinking fruit drinks like Kool-Ade during the summers as a kid. Mouthfeel was medium. The light carbonation gave the fruitiness of the hops a chance to really shine. It was as mellow as tea, but a) I have not had a fruity tea in many years, so that may not be fair and b) there was a sharpness that was in-tea-like &amp; a jolt out of any lethargy into which I may have been lulled.\n",

Moderate lacing remains on the glass. S: Beautiful and nuanced, with decadent fermented grain, varietal flowers, and juicy peach that is totally dishonest in its authenticity, belying the fact that no fruit was used in the brewing of this beer. Unfortunately the most interesting volatile smells fade too quickly, gone long before the liquid that harbored them. T: Begins off-dry, with bright and surprisingly spirituous toasted malt as well as floral and delicate citrus hop aromatics. Acidity lends a faint tartness that pairs pleasantly with the fresh stone fruit flavors of the middle. Fruity elements are remarkably clean, tasting more like a beer fermented with real fruit--rather than one rich in ale yeast esters. Sweetness also peaks in the middle, again matching the other flavors appropriately. Dryness becomes resurgent in the finish, with moderate bitterness, and fruit turning more vinous. Pilsner malt lingers on the palate. M: Thin viscosity, wet and slightly sticky on the palate, with low carbonation. D/O: This unique and special pale ale is one of those beers that seems like more than the sum of its parts--it seems fantastically complex and interesting for the style. It is so focused in its fruity, yeasty qualities that it could masquerade as a fruit beer of Belgian origin in a blind tasting. While it could be considered experimental for the style, it doesn't quite cross the line into extreme--except for its high price tag.\n",

      "Got this in a trade with gkunkle. Thanks for the opportunity man. My first Hair of the Dog beer. A - Pours a cloudy golden color. It has a thick very rocky white head with great retention. Nice lacing going on in a circular fashion. Also i see some sediment at the bottom of my glass. S - Sweet orane and pineapples along with some sour apricots and some fresh grains. Smells pleasant. T - A little more bitter than the nose would indicate. There is some sweet citrus and a little bit of a candy sweetness in the middle. Finish is bitter/sweet with a bit of a lingering medicinal aftertaste. M - Mouthfeel is good. Smooth and sorta creamy. Carbonation is just right for the style. I like it D/N - Not bad. Its a good drinking beer all in all. The flavors just didn't do it for me. There was some medicinal properties in there that i could have done without. Far from terrible though. I think in the future I would probably give this beer another shot. Especially if i saw it on tap. Worth a go if you find it and haven't had it.\n"

Very faint off-white lace. Smell: Intense citrus and somewhat sweet smelling. Apple, pineapple (ethyl hex?), or maybe it's a bit oxidized. Slight perfume. Different, but not really that appealing.

Not much going on here at all. T- Starts out with light fruit, caramel malt. Finishes with a mix of pine/floral hops, light fruit, and biscuit/bready malt. Slight Belgian yeast and spice throughout along with some nutty hints. MF- Light body that is somewhat creamy and stings the palate just a bit from high carbonation. Surprising amount of bitterness coats the tongue. DB- Nothing jumps out at me, the overall flavor isn't anything special. Middle of the line, not flavorful or flavorless.

Light malts, grainy...in fact, I would not be surprised if there were not any specialty malts here. Orange peel and grapefruit citrus are so very nice. Biscuity malt with a touch of lightly toasted white bread is balanced by a citric hop presence. Hops battle for flavor and finishing supremacy with the bittering ultimately winning out. I like how the malts are light and slightly thin and let the hops shine through so very well. So much citrus...leaves the grass, pine and herbal hop aspects behind and tastes succulent. Very good brew, one of the better PAs I have had.\n",

Nose is tropical with citrus notes. Taste is well balanced but the hops win in the end. Mango stands out with some grapefruit and pine in the background. Getting some liquid bread notes from the caramel and pale malts. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and pretty refreshing.

Had the lager version of this awhile back and gave it a 3.35. Having less hope for this one, especially since it’s almost 20 months old.

      "I'd like to offer a modest, and honest opinion on this beer. A lot of people are bashing it and I'm not so sure why. My inclination is snobbery. Look, looks great! Copper as most people say, with little (if any) lacing. The color can be a touch misleading, I expected something with more bite and bitter. Personally, the smell doesn't do much for me, then again I smoke and probably shouldn't offer too much opinion on smell. The taste, unlike what many have said, is not bad, is not bitter and is quite nice to me. I drink IPA, and stout usually. It is what I (and others here) would call thin but that isn't always bad. Refreshing, and enjoyable especially on a hot day. I certainly wouldn't turn my nose up if it was offered to me. If I didn't know it to be gluten free, which is why I serve it, I would never know. The mouth feel is faint, with just enough carbonation. In conclusion, it is very easy to be critical of beer in a new craft world, but let's rate this beer for what it is. A gluten free beer will obviously \"miss something\". But for those who can't drink any beer on the shelf, this will please. In my opinion this far surpasses Redbridge. If you want a complex beer experience full of adventure and distinguished notes then this beer wasn't made for you. It was made for those who cannot consume gluten yet still wish to enjoy beer. Overall, this is a good beer. The flavor is nice, even if short lived. A bit tame, but certainly enjoyable. Sometimes simple is best. This is one of those times.\n",

      "12oz bottle, the first Widmer product to make it into the Alberta market, and wouldn't you know it has to be a gluten-free offering. This beer pours a mildly hazy, medium copper amber colour, with one stout finger of weakly puffy, and mostly just bubbly off-white head, which leaves some attractive ocean spray lace around the glass as it easily slips away. It smells of reserved bready caramel malt, a soft biscuity graininess, orange cream, understated pine and leafy hop notes, and a tame earthy yeastiness. The taste is more semi-sweet bready caramel malt, dry biscuity saltines, an ethereal orange and neutered grapefruit fruitiness, well-faded yeast, and a surprisingly peppy earthy, leafy, and somewhat grassy hoppiness. The bubbles are generally active and supportive in their straight-up frothiness, the body a decent medium weight for the style, and a bit too tacky to be deemed particularly smooth. It finishes rather dry, the biscuity nature starting to subsume the whole, as it were. Another pleasantly rendered gluten-free ale, if it absolutely has to be done. Since they state on the label that this is made with 'malted barley, specially crafted to be gluten-free', I'm gonna lump this in with the enzyme removal method for further classification, since there are still residual (albeit below the governing body's standard) proteins flitting about here.\n",

Taste - has the leafy hop quality again, but it seems to fall a bit flat for me. Mild malt flavour blended in. Mouthfeel - smooth, but a bit flat and lacking carbonation.

      "Copper-red and translucent visually, this is a bit darker than your average pale ale. Seeing as this beer is also sweeter than I would expect; I'm going to go ahead and say that this probably has a higher portion rich and sweet specialty malts in the mash bill than your common pale ale. Coming in at 5.8% abv this alcohol content is good for a session beer. Cascade and Citra hops are present adding a nice piny and fruity flavor to beer but they could be more pronounced. I would also like more bitterness in this one. All and all its a good pale ale but not a great one. It deviates a bit from the style. Good beer nonetheless.\n",

Citrusy, dry floral stand.  M: Medium base, frothy feel, creamy with a decent level of carbonation and a dry citrusy grainy leave.  O: Decent hop level, needs some time to warm up to but does get better. Was totally unaware this was gluten free so that is a good thing, usually a stigma attached to such beers but from what im reading this is a special patent process that is brewed with regular barley and has the gluten removed after.

Watery and thin mouthfeel.

I hope we don't have to have a special category for no gluten beers, but if we did this would be the gold medal winner. It is interesting in proving that barley is the right grain for making beer.

S- Bouquet reflected the taste. T- Really nice earthy, nutty, almost candied malts up front with a piney hop finish that is just the right amount of bitterness.  M- I didn't make any notes on mouthfeel.  O- Nicely complex. I wasn't surprised to find out this was Captain Lawrence's Freshchester Pale Ale. I'll definitely be picking this up again. I like supporting New York breweries, especially if they are putting out high quality products like this.\n",

      "Pours a burnt orange with a finger of off white soapy head. Extremely lively, lots of carbonation bubbles shooting up from the bottom of my glass. Bready with a decent amount of pine and some slight tropical hops on the nose. The taste stays in the same line. Bready backbone with some nice piney hops. I get a slight tinge of citrus, but not too much. Medium bodied with a nice carbonation sting on the tongue. Very smooth and easy to drink. Slightly dry hop finish. Definitely the highlight of the beer. Overall this is an easy drinking pale ale. The mouthfeel made this beer without a doubt but the nose and taste were pretty solid as well. Nothing special here but I wouldn't kick a six pack of this out of bed for eating crackers if you catch my drift.\n",

      "This is one of my favorite pale ales and it is often overlooked from among other pale ales as well as other captain lawrence offerings (especially the Liquid Gold). I think this is their best beer and very drinkable any time of day or any season. Very good hops character without being too overhwhelming. And at 5.6% ABV, very sessionable. Ask your local beer bar to provide this beer.\n",

      "Had during beer dinner at crossroads. this was paired with a pizzette with roasted red pepper sauce, goat cheese &amp; prosciutto. It was a delicious pairing The beer is a clear orangey amber color with a nice light head that leaves some gently lacing and doesn't disappear immediately. Pleasant and appetizing appearance. Smell is of american hops. Citrus and piney notes, maybe a bit of apricot. It's not overwhelming hops, a bit restrained and I can already tell that this is going to be decently(not a flattering adverb) balanced pale ale. Taste is very smooth and well balanced. Good bit of american hops present (gentle hops and fruity notes), but balanced by a good dose of malts (bready and toasted) Drinkability is quite high. This is something that will go on to my kegerator during the summer (if I had one!) What I mean is that I would love to drink this all the time especially in the summer. Just something that I can drink and enjoy all day.\n",

      "Reviewed from notes. This was purchased at a Total Wine here in Florida when they got a special shipment from the folks at Surly, and the can was less than three weeks old at the time of consumption. Poured from a 16 oz. can into a J. Wakefield OG teku glass. A: Hazy gold – a gold that's a few shades darker than most APAs. Forms a finger's worth of white head with average retention, and a good amount of visible carbonation. S: Big tropical fruits and tangerine. Fresh cut pineapple, dank, and cracker malts. Milder grapefruit, piney and floral. A nice and big aroma for an APA. T: Tropical fruit and oranges, pineapple and dank. A light cracker malt sweetness. Lighter resinous oils and floral/herbal hops. A disappearing light bitterness in the hang, and some mild graininess on the exhale. There’s also a thin, metallic flavor in the hang of which I’m not a fan. M: A light body and low alcohol flavors. A good amount of carbonation sensation initially, but it disappears very quickly. The combination of these leads to a bit strange of a mouthfeel - it's a bit thin, even for an APA. O: A nice aroma and flavors, but the grainy and metallic flavors are enough that this wouldn’t be my go-to choice, even were it regularly available on shelves around here. The mouthfeel with the odd carbonation is a bit off-putting as well. You could do worse, but there are better options around.\n",

      "16 ounce can into an oversized tulip. 3/17/2016 can.  Surprisingly lacking in foam on the pour. Very little head forms over the golden body with a copper hue. Carbonation is clearly visible and rises incessantly, feeding a slight film over the body. 3.75 Pretty light on aroma, but I do get some faint grapefruit, unripe mango and some hints of OJ. Also hints at light resin and biscuity malt. I like what I'm smelling but struggle to get much of it. 3.5 The flavor appeals more to me than the aroma, with a more pronounced (compared to the nose) grapefruit flavor and zest and a pleasant biscuit-with-honey malt taste. Very lightly, sweet tangerine peeks in. The finish is a touch floral. All throughout the flavors are gentle and approaching timid, but still enjoyable. 3.5 Light-bodied to the point of almost being watery, the zesty citrus bite and floral bitter finish help give this a beer feel. Sweetness is there in a fleeting way that doesn't distract from the zest or bitterness, although especially given the bitter finish, a more generous sweet push could be welcome. 3.5 This ain't bad as an easy-drinker, but it may not satisfy on the flavor and body front for most.\n",

The flavors are much as expected from the nose with light citric fruity flavors backed up by some malt and some light sweetness with a bit of bitterness.

Pumpkin orange in color, bright with a faint gauziness, more of a metallic yellow around the rims, quietly effective. Mild creaminess to the nose helps set you at ease and get the pink grapefruit citrus, pear, apple, peach fruit going, although the malts and cocoa powder given equal billing, nothing here very sweet, best experienced as a whole than analyzing the parts. Medium-bodied, uses the weight it has to set itself firmly in the mouth. Again, a more gentle and inviting presentation of the orange, lemon citrus as well as peach, apricot, red apple fruit. The herbaceous bite in the hops much clearer here, yet, not sufficient to upset the apple cart. Pine cone and flower petals spread as the beer warms some. Carbonation might be a touch too fluffy.

I will point to this entry as a shining example of how it really should be done. I recently scored this bottle at the FGBS &amp; after a day of odds &amp; sods, I am ready for any hop-driven beer. Bring it on! From the bottle: \"In early 2014, Tony Gwynn’s team approached AleSmith to create a distinctive beer for the baseball legend. A meeting was called at the Gwynn household, which included a sampling of AleSmith beers to identify Tony’s preferences. He wanted the beer to be 'light with a kick' which he elaborated further to mean full of hop character and light in body and color.\"; \"The result of the Gwynn family’s feedback on test batches rendered a golden pale ale full of American hop flavor and aroma, with a subdued bitterness and a malty sweet finish.\"; \"AleSmith San Diego Pale Ale .394 pays tribute to the city that Tony loved and the career high batting average that he achieved in ‘94. Discover what happens when a Hall of Fame perfectionist crafts a beer with a world-class brewery. A portion of the proceeds will go to the Tony and Alicia Gwynn Foundation (TAG).\" All of that on a painted, cadmium-infused label means only one thing - once emptied, it s getting rinsed &amp; saved. I am so disappointed with the sticker labels coming out of Stone's east coast facility. Boo hoo.  I Pop!ped the cap &amp; as I now wont to do, I performed a very gentle pour. I followed this fairly quickly with a vigorous in-glass swirl to raise two-plus fingers of foamy, rocky, bone-white head with moderate retention that left some great, sticky lacing in its wake. Color was solid Amber (SRM = &gt; 7, &lt; 9) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled of both bready malts and pineapple/tropical fruity hops. OMG, I am SO ready to drink a hoppy beer! Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was very evocative of a pineapple upside-down cake! Man, loads of sweet pineapple-like hops but backed with bready, cake-like malt. This kind of makes my day! I saw Tony Gwynn a few times, especially in 1987 when they played the Buccos while still wearing the original tan, brown and yellow uniforms. Have you ever looked at a slice of pineapple upside-down cake? Same colors! Coincidence? I think not! This was quite tasty. Finish was semi-dry, mainly because the hops did not overwhelm the malts. This was a really nice segue into my next beer.\n",

S - Citrus and light tropical fruit are at the forefront of the palate...  Oranges... Pineapple... Kiwis... This sits atop a sweet malty base... Caramel... Toffee... An outstanding aroma for an American Pale Ale... Quite enticing...  T - The flavor profile is a bit more muddled... A rich bready base asserts itself throughout... The hops take on more of an earthy presence... Much of the sweetness (tropical fruit &amp; caramel) never really materializes on the palate...  M - Medium bodied... Dense from the get go...

      "I tasted this beer from tap at the brewery in Nashville. I was quite impressed with the lovely color when it was poured, it was not at all a weak, watery looking shade of gold as the term \"pale ale\" brings to mind, but a beautiful warm honey-colored gold. The head fizzled to just a ring in a very short time. The lacing was verticle, very wet and streaky for the duration of the glass. The smell was fairly pleasant, honey and hops, kinda strong on the hops. Yes, very hoppy in taste, tangy, the hops really pops, especially in the aftertaste. The aftertaste was not really offensive, just bitter, too much for me. I guess some would consider it refreshing but it was too bitter for me. The mouthfeel was great however. Light in body but still round and full in the way of not being at all watery, it was substantial, just enough carbonation, and smooth.  The mouthfeel made this drinkable, but as I mentioned the taste was too bitter. I had a rough time finishing my sampler glass.\n",

      "A: Poured a medium-burnt orange with a compact 1 finger tan colored head that was short lived. Visible carbonation was light, while the clarity was semi-hazy. The lacing was spotty, weak, and sudsy failing to cling nor impress with much regard.  S: The nose delivered a spicy hopping of dried pineapple backed by a toasted caramel malting. Spicy citrusy flowerys also add nice accents here.  T: The flavor had a spicy hop bite of fresh citrus and fresh grapefruit pulp. A dry toasted munich offering adds a dry toasty feel and subtle dry sweet notes form the grains. Hints of dried fruitiness (pineapple) and lemons add a spicy brightness amongst the dry toasted palate. Im unfamiliar with Sorachi hops which were used so im guessing they provided the fruity yet citrusy (lemony) hopping that im deriving from the taste. The beer finishes up with a creamy maltiness and a light dry alcohol warming.Overall a pretty big experience especially for one labeled as a pale that drinks on the level of most ipas. Not that im complaining but im starting to miss the days of the traditional pale ales, you know when they were actually composed of pale grains, crisp with a moderate bitterness (SNPA and Samuel Smiths come to mind) instead of this one up on the bitterness and loaded with specialty grain movement that has been occurring of late. Though I didn't find it particular to my expectations I still find it hard to say that the flavor was less then good, maybe just not particular to style, but I find it hard to punish such offenses of pushing the envelope of style.  M: The mouthful was medium-ful with a soft bubbly sensation that allows this to turn to a thick luscious creamy feel on the hold. Dry citrus flowers and toasted grain grace the tongue upon the swallow.  D: A big drinking experience, much more so on ipa standards then pale with a nice addition of hop flavors that were like, but also unlike your typical west coast hopping, which im sure is compliments of the Sorachi. Good level of enjoyment though a bomber suited me well. Expect to drink an ipa when you meet up with this one, not your typical quench thristing, session pale.\n",

      "Gotta love the name. Appearance: This beer poured a rich dull copper that was unexpected given the fact that it's a pale ale. A thick, frothy light tan head formed and later blanketed the beer in my Duvel tulip. The beer appears hazy, but not unfiltered. Smell: Whoa, the smell gives you the best first impression of this beer. It has moved beyond a pale ale and into a category of extreme brewing. I am reminded of my first impressions with immortale by DFH, but the vanilla and maple isn't as strong. Taste: Spicy, Yeast, and Hoppppy bitterness. The ale is rich and gives the beer a good body to encompass these flavors. The bitterness from the hops is pure pine sap and way overpowering to give me any type of frothing in my loins (oregasmic). However, the beer remains decent, superior to many even still. Mouthfeel: Slightly off centered, the bitter aftertaste is gross after a while. The beer reminds me of a hoppy ale, borderline IPA-Belgian hybrid possibly. The sweetness comes through more effortlessly when the beer is warmed, but is a scavenger hunt. Drinkability: I liked this beer and thought it was a fairly drinkable beverage, especially for the price. There were off moments about the beer, but overall it had remarkable character and a smooth finish (despite a harsh, bitter aftertaste). I would compare this beer to wild devil belgian IPA or even a scotch ale. At a restaurant I think it would pair poorly, but if the opportunity arises I may still challenge my initial opinions.\n",

Leafy, herbal hops set in about halfway through, brought out by carbonation effects. Dry finish. Mildly rindy, earthy aftertaste. Well-balanced overall. As others have suggested, tea-like.

The flavors couldn't line up more with the nose as the earth, floral and herbal hops are gentle on the tongue. Light tea leave malt support the overall hop presence.

Aroma is surprisingly malt-forward; roasted toffee is especially evident. Biscuit and caramel accompany this, along with a pine resiny hoppiness. Considering the lineup of hops listed on the bottle, I was expecting much more.  Flavor is fairly sweet with a bit of resin in the background. Sweet caramel/toffee and a bit nutty and bready. Mild bitterness to provide a nice finish, but overall this is a touch too sweet, especially considering it's a pale ale.  Medium bodied and medium carbonation. Kind of soapy mouthfeel.  Overall, this isn't a particularly good beer. Too sweet but with a bitter aftertaste. Not much of a hoppy flavor mind you, just bitter.

A decent amount of muted hop flavors that finish in a slightly too pronounced bitterness. M: It's a rather medium-heavy mouthfeel that sits a little heavy. Other than the low ABV, I'm not sure if would really consider this a session ale due to how filling it is.

Smell is malty, mostly, which is surprising for a dry-hopped APA. Taste is a nice mix of malt and hops, which creates a rich flavor and mouthfeel.

The malt is especially light, although a sharp sweet caramel undertone carries the beer. The hops are headliners, though. It seems they use more than their fair share of the flower to give the beer flavor at 5.2abv.  Quick lemon citrus up front, followed closely by the caramel. A bit spicy and a good shovel of grapefruit rolled in pine needles. I gotta say, for 5.2 it does pack some flava. Still, the caramel seems a bit harsh, and with the pine it almost seems boozy. The bread/malt is not bread enough.  Still, a solid session beer that I will polish off (6pk) very soon.\n",

Weak broken lace is faint on the vessel.  S: Warrior hops are first to jump out at me, really nice especially if you’re a fan. Fresh lemony zest from the simcoe, freshly toasted munich grains, lemongrass with some warm piney flowers. There is a bit of herbal oregano and a soft woodsy touch of pine that was of moderate display.  T: Warm piney honeyed flavor, sweetly fresh toasted caramel grains, sweet lemongrass, oregano and again some woodsy pine hints start the open. Cascade citrusy hops soon follow with a fruity character of pineapple-orange. Things conclude with some grassiness and some intermittent sweet fruity hoppy moments.  M: Light bodied, very smooth and slick textured with a soft carbonation factor.  O: Overall a nice blending of hops that works well together, sweet and fruity meets some wet citrusy hops that had a nice level of appeal. It is the hop complexity and blending and flow of the flavor that really defines this beer as a six-pack worthy, and multiple downer.\n",

The mouthfeel is medium with mild carbonation. Overall, I'll rate Trail Head Pale Ale | Fat Head's Brewery &amp; Saloon with a 4.25.

Mouthfeel was medium, kind of soft, actually. The tropical fruit flavors were prevalent in my mouth and on my tongue. Mmm. The lacing that was now beginning to develop was going to require a jackhammer to remove later. No wonder this medaled! It was not overly bitter, it had a great mouthfeel and it was going down really easy. A little too easily, in fact. I drank well over half of it without really giving it much thought.

      "Perhaps not quite as hoppy as some of its other California counterparts, I still think this classic American pale is a lot better than its ratings, and these guys never get enough credit for their hoppy offerings I don't think. Some ready slightly sweet malt backbone, but it's more about structure than flavor, and I appreciate the role of the slightly richer grain bill here. Citrus in the hops, orange to me, with plenty of balancing bitterness on the back end and a grassy bite that makes it distinct. A little more filling than others, but also somehow more balanced and approachable. I don't dig it quite as much as the acme IPA, but this is really solid beer, especially when it's fresh. Surprised to see it so fresh here in Puerto Rico, but interest in American craft has exploded, and I am pleased to find such a diverse selection of beers not available in Colorado on the island deemed to be a beer wasteland by those less inclined to seek out the goodies.

      "12 fl oz brown glass bottle acquired as part of a 6 pack at the Cap N Cork in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live. Expectations are fairly high given the brewery, which I'm a fan of. Label art is as generic as they come; you could easily mistake this for a World Brews offering.  Served cold - straight from the fridge. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.  A: Pours a two finger wide head of beige/light khaki colour. Decent frothiness. Okay creaminess and thickness. Retention is nice - about 3-4 minutes. Inconsistent lacing sticks to the sides of the glass as the head recedes.  Body colour is a vibrant orange-copper. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show.  Overall, it's pretty standard fare for a pale ale. No overt flaws are obvious. It's not unique or special. Sm: British malts are evident. I get toffee, caramel, biscuit, a bit of nutty digestive, pale malts, and floral hops. A simple aroma of mild strength. No yeast character or alcohol is detectable.  T: Pale malts are overtaken by the British malts - including the aforementioned toffee, biscuit, caramel, and digestive notes. Too bready and grainy for the style. Hop character is reticent - a crime in a pale ale. What little I do pick up is generic and floral in character. Some toasted grain. Almost a light butterscotch (diacetyl) note. Balance is okay, but the build is all wrong for the style. Not very pleasant as a result. A simple brew without much subtlety. I'm not a huge fan. Mf: Smooth and wet. Overcarbonated. Thickness suits the style. Fairly full-bodied. Suits the flavour profile generally well, but it doesn't feel custom-tailored to it. Decent execution. Dr: Ultimately, it's a disappointing attempt at a pale ale from a brewery that should know better. I definitely wouldn't buy this again, but I'm glad I got the chance to try it. Downable stuff, but by no means high quality. I expected better from North Coast.  C\n",

It is a fine beer but nothing is special about it, just another APA. Well done though.\n",

Nose is immidiately sharp citrus / grapefruit surprisingly. Only the faintest hint of malt auroma. Taste is like a muted version of the smell, although the hops stand up very well allowing a bitter aftertaste. Very well rounded body where the malt balances nicely against the amount of hops. There must be something special in Michigan water that Ontario brewers can't duplicate, because this Pale is hoppier and more like an IPA than any IPA availble from On. craft brewers. Overall this beer hits all the right notes; sessionable, flavourful, hoppy and enjoyable all round. Kudos to Shorts. (If only they could get better ink for stamping their bottles!)\n",

      "A 12 oz bottle from Plum Market in Ann Arbor, MI. A: The APA has a tea-colored orange/brown hue that is brightly translucent. A steady stream of carbonation, illuminated by the clarity, bubbles upward in a constant motion. A finger of white head nicely blanketed the ale, lacing as it recedes. S: The pale ale has a fresh, vegetal hoppy aroma. The aroma isn't overpowering but there is a strength hanging around. Pale malts, bready, are a formidable foil to the hops. T: The hops are quite earthy, a dirty citrusy flavor that takes control of the entire ale. A bit of spice follows the hops, adding heat to the mix. Pale malts create a biscuity environment, light compliment to the hops. The hops, as the ale warms, have a mild mintiness that leaves a lasting flavor in my mouth. M: The mouthfeel needs some time to settle down and release the flavorful hops. The minty, earthy hops go down easily, a nice sipper. D: A well-made pale ale that holds up over time (I bought this bottle in mid-June). It's nice to see that the regular line-up is as solid as the specialty offerings.\n",

A funky/grassy note at the finish. Taste - From first sip, lots of caramel malts with a bitter pale malt flavor. Some hops come out near the finish and add some grapefruit and orange, along with some lemon. Some sugars and spices add even more sweetness. Drinks more like a amber ale. Mouthfeel - Tongue gets mostly malts with some mild hop notes. Palate gets remaining malts, along with some sugars and bitter hops. Aftertaste is malty, a little bitter and dry.

      "Pours a near-brilliant golden-amber in color (\"Brass\"), topped with a pale tan head of minimal duration. Lacing is minimal. Nose pretty good: juicy malt character matched with ample and well-defined hop use. I'm getting notes of pear from the malts and lighter notes of pineapple from the hops. On first sip its rather bitter and lightly astringent, followed by a gentle sweetness, a nice brisk feeling on the palate, and a lingering bittersweet quality. Biscuit malt character certainly plays a part here, and there's even a melon (honeydew) note here! Other notes: lemon peel/rind, tart green apple, and some golden or white grapes -- I'm just gonna throw out a guess that Maris Otter was used as a specialty malt here, along with crystal and pale as a base. A nice sipper, but big enough (or small enough?) that more than one in a sitting / session / whatever wouldn't be a poor decision at all. Certainly above average.

Appearance: cooper brown with a orange glaze, kind of reminds me of a summer type beer. Golden amber has been lately a favorite of mine Smell: Hoppness with a strong sense of aronma that really doesn't bring anything special. Taste: earthy hops and hints of orange slices possibly with an almost smoked sweetness grainy feeling. Mouthfeel: Medium to light body and moderate carbonation. Drinkability: This beer has some mean potiental and something I could see myself enjoying, however not this perticular moment. Not a bad brew but if the bitterness be tweaked a bit, I could see myself drinking this on a more regular basis. Final Thought: Okay when I first cracked this beer open, I wasn't expecting a renaissance-type beer to really blow me away. The orange citrusy is something I wasn't enjoying. A beer I would recommend to anyone just starting out drinking APA's. Cheers to anyone drinking this.\n",

      "Bought as part of a sample pack in Dallas, TX. Poured into a stange glass. Pours hazy yellow with two fingers of white head that falls quickly and laces impressively.  Smells lightly of hops, especially of the noble variety (the labs states this was made with Saaz). More grassy than citrusy. A bit of pale light malt is also detectable, rather like dried sweet-grass.  Immediately a rather robust dose of bitterness smacks the tongue. From there on out the bitterness is rather harsh without tasting especially good. The Saaz hops are interesting, but not what I would expect from an APA, as in this beer they seem to add bitterness but not the classic flavors. The malts are unusually pale in color and flavor, and come through tasting more like a blonde ale than a typical pale. The mouthfeel is rather nice, with lively carbonation and an unfiltered feel. Drinkability is hurt by the high bitterness though. Conclusion: I like and dislike this beer for the same reason; it isn't really like an American-style pale ale. It tastes like a blend of a blonde ale (or even cream ale) and a hopped up pilsner. I don't think that blend of flavors tastes amazing, but I enjoy the fact that Real Ale is doing something with their pale ale that sets it apart from the multitude of pale ales that all taste exactly the same.\n",

Czech Saaz hops are prominently displayed throughout the bitterness here, especially in the brew's finish.  D: There's something overall here though that keeps from urging me on to make this something \"I must have again.\" The palate is an ever changing and complex judge and at this point I felt like mine needed more or possibly less of something here to keep me coming back for more of this interpretation of this style. But that's just my palate and I will consider this worthy of another shot when I get the chance to try it again.\n",

There is a mild sweetness that definitely is at the forefront. Gives it a nice \"carmelesque\" type flavor...not overpowering in any way, just the perfect amount.

A golden ale, Blue Heron has a full body with a refreshing, distinctive hop character. Blue Heron leaves a fresh, clean, hoppy aftertaste. This ale is made with pale malted barley, whole hops, and our special yeast and water. The Legend.\" Amber gold color, slightly hazy with lots of fine particles floating around. The foam is slightly off white, forming a solid cap of head. Good retention, nice looking and lasting lace. The smell has all the requisite hoppy notes, floral, some citrus. The taste does have some hoppiness to it, but quite subdued. A bitter after taste leaves a funny coating in the mouth. Not much as far as malt balance. It has some hoppy bite, but not the clean, resinous hop oil I have come to expect from an APA. For me, it is falls in to the category of 'just good enough'. Not bad, but not great either.

Moderate lacing. Decently fragrant nose, but not too complex. I can distinguish a couple fruity/grassy hops and just some buttery malt falling in behind. That's about it. Don't have to search too hard for it, though, which is a plus in my book.  The beer takes a dip in the flavor department. Not very assertive on the ol' tongue, plus it's not very hoppy, which I like in an APA (I guess I kinda judge by Sierra Nevada Pale Ale). Sweeter, fruitier hops and a bit of caramel malt shows up, but it's not nearly hoppy enough for me. Mainly malty, this thing needs a hop injection to be considered a pale ale IMO.  Alright mouthfeell. A few notches short of medium, the beer also has a moderate amount of carbonation that sort of helps to blend the flavors with the mouthfeel a bit. Not bad here.  Overall, I'm not too impressed with this beer. It definitely needs a hop injection to be considered a viable pale ale in my book. Still, it's drinkable, just not best in show.

So, I finally did, and was excited to try it, BUT I am quite disappointed with this brew.  For starters, it was 11-something dollars a 6-pack, which I think is absolutely ridiculous (after having tasted it of course). The one thing I keep saying to myself is, \"There is absolutely nothing unique or special about this beer.\" It is SO bland. Okay, the hops are there, the barley is there, its sort-of malty, but it is SO lackluster. The color is a sort-of light golden yellow. It has NO head to speak of. There is considerable carbonation and the mouth feel isn't really all that bad, but after gulping down your just left unimpressed. To me, it's just a really bland classic pale ale. There is nothing else to it. It doesn't have a big hop bite and there are no distinctive flavor notes to speak of whatsoever. If it has one thing going for it, I would have to say that it is its drinkability. Simply put, it goes down easy, and refreshes.  That's all I've got for this one folks.

Not much malt is apparent....the cutting, astringent bitterness takes over and spreads with a pretty high intensity all over the tongue. This is a pale ale that definitely isn't shy about the hops...reminiscent of SN, really. Although I just don't find it as enjoyable as other APA's.

Always a treat to try another Hill Farmstead beer.Just yesterday enjoyed and reviewed Six Point Spice of Life (Nelson) IPA. Wanted to have these back to back to see how they stacked up.  A finger of white head forms and fades fairly quickly. The beer is a slightly hazy orange color with no visible carbonation. Rings of lace form with every sip.  Aroma is a burst of tangerine, citrus and tropical fruit. Very heavy tangerine. Nice.  Flavor is excellent (no surprise) The fruit burst is here for sure and the tangerine/citrus is certainly features. What’s funny is that the flavor is less tangerine focused vs. the aroma. Some more grassy notes in the flavor along with just a touch of hop resin greenness. Light cracker malt flavors with nice bread notes below the surface. But the Nelson hop is center stage all the way. The finish is a nice combination of green bitterness, fruit and a bit of citrus peel. I think lemon now and again, but it seems to pull back and head in a more tropical direction. Nice light refreshing body. The bitterness almost makes it finish with a dry edge, but I love that.

The head is a pure cotton white while the body is a medium amber which glows a yellow orange when held up to the light. A fair amount of lacing is being left behind.  Nose- Certainly smells like an IPA- very warm and inviting. All the usual suspects are there: pine, citrus (orange and lemon), resin, and hints of spice. The lemon notes last longer than any other scent.  Taste- This is reflective of the nose but is a little bit more subdued especially when it comes to the pine and resin. The citrus levels are about the same as they are on the nose but there is definitely more spice on the palate. Not the most exciting pale ale as it seems a little thin and watery. Some resin does linger on the finish. A good pale ale but not in the same league as a SNPA or a Red Chair. The aroma promises more than the flavor profile delivers though it is true to the style. Slight hints of grapefruit appear after some minutes.  Mouthfeel- Light bodied with just a little carbonation. It could maybe use more.  Drinkability- Pretty easygoing but a little boring at the same time. A little more expensive than my standard pale ales. Probably won't buy again.

Orange citrus flavor with wheat bread malt that doesn't last long before the piney hop bitterness takes over and lingers a good while. very balanced in viscosity but acidic in feel from the dry hopping, no doubt. If I was to make an American Pale for a brewery, I'd make it solid and slightly different. Drakes made it boldly different, and I have to admit it payed off.

The pine and grapefruit reminds me of a nice Pliny. Nothing could be better about this smell and if they made an air freshener with this I would buy cases of it. There are few smells that instantly make me smile. This is one of them.  Taste- The taste is built around the hops. No noticeable maltiness, but some residual sweetness. Bitterness a little high for this style, but it is very close. Amazingly the aroma and hops don't overpower, but I cannot put my finger on why. Mouthfeel - Smooth with just a little stickiness at the end. The aroma reminded me of Pliny but the taste and mouthfeel are more typical of the pale ale style. I would like just a tidbit more body. Overall - This is a about as good as a pale ale gets. The dry hopping really does it for me. The best way to describe this is a Pliny light.

The whole plastic wrap thing not only looks tacky, but it also smacks of needless extra expense. Now, to the beer itself. Massive carbonation on the pour! It took me nearly five pours, waiting for the head to recede, before I even took one sip of the brew. Translucent, deep honey color to this beer, more reminiscent of an English ESB than a pale. There is one hoppy nose to this pour. Not much citrus but tons of pine. There is a rich malt character hidden in there too somewhere, but I fear I don't have the capacity to place it. Lower marks for the mouthfeel. I want a more substantial presence on the palate that this beer is too over-carbonated to provide. Interesting hop profile to this beer, not in a bad way either. It almost has a juniper quality to it that makes me think of gin. Again, not too much citrus in the hopping, which I think is a fault, but the beer maintains a powerful bitter profile. Good drinkability, especially if one is partial to the piny effervescence this brew provides. This is really a unique beer. Nearly impossible to qualify, it certainly will satisfy.\n",

The head is persistent, however, and the glass ends up with a few blips of sudsy lace. The nose is pure West Coast APA/IPA. Plenty of juicy grapefruit makes guessing the hop bill a no-brainer. Centennial (and maybe one of the other C-hops) is almost certainly in use. The only thing that's Imperial about this 5.2% ale is that it supposedly contains an IIPA's amount of hops. We'll see about that.  1500 Pale Ale just might contain an IPA's amount of hops. Given the APA-like ABV, does that make it an Imperial pale ale? Quite possibly. Enough with the style discussion, just know that this brew is a very well-hopped, pale-malted ale that is damn tasty if you happen to be a quart low on lupulins. Other than a slight nod toward toasted bread, the barley side of things is all crackery malt. There aren't enough malt sugars for it to be biscuity. Pure essence of white grapefruit is aided by a bit of lemoniness. Each mouthful is brought to a close with a bitter-tart, dry, crisp finish. Simple beer. Drinkable beer. Good beer. Forget how the head looks (which isn't bad, after all), because there's a boatload of crusty lace on the glass in the end. The mouthfeel isn't as buzzy as first feared. In terms of heft, it's right on the money for the style... as long as we forget all that 'Imperial' nonsense. 1500 Pale Ale was so named because it was Drake's Brewing's 1500th batch since opening their doors in 1989. That isn't much beer over that much time, but then everything these guys brew is good to outstanding. Quality over quantity is the very definition of craft beer. Bottom line: this one doesn't disappoint... especially if you're a hophead.\n",

      "Matt Brewing Co. \"Saranac Big Moose Winter Ale\" 12 fl. oz. brown glass bottle, coded \"2768 10:30\" $2 @ Wegmans, King of Prussia, PA Notes via stream of consciousness: So this is a winter ale with Citrus and Amarillo hops? Sounds a little tropical to me, or is that the idea? Seriously, they call it an American pale ale themselves. Anyway, it's poured a slightly hazy deep gold/light amber body beneath a two-finger thick head of white that's already dropped to about a half an inch. The aroma is pretty hoppy, and I'm finding more of the resinous, floral, and citrusy Centennial hops than I am the Citrus or Amarillo. So when was this actually brewed? I'm assuming October 3rd based on the code; that's just over a month ago. That implies that the hops haven't faded, but I'm still not getting much Citra and Amarillo, just a little of that lemon and orange. OK, on to the flavor... well there's definitely more Citrus there, and Amarillo. Centennial is present as well. A basic golden malt supports the hops and balances them. A firm bitterness then balances the malt, 45 IBUs according to the neck label. In the mouth it's medium bodied and crisp. Looking back, although the head dropped initially it's still a solid cap, which is nice, and there's some nice lacing left behind. The haze is distracting seeing as how it's an APA, but OK, whatever. Overall it's OK, it's not bad, it's a decent enough APA but it lacks that certain je nais se quoi that makes some beers special.  Review# 6,341\n",

Nose is toast and caramel maltiness with a light, citric hop aroma. Finger nail polish remover and Pine-Sol throw out some less than desirable nostril candy. Label claims \"Triple dry hopped with specialty Citra, Centennial and Cascade hops...\" Sure as hell coulda fooled me.  Taste is moderately better with a thin, caramely malt flavor with some burnt biscuit bottoms and a biting bitterness on the back end that...well, for lack of a better word, sucks. Kinda like putting an aspirin in your mouth before you get the glass of water and having some dissolve on the back of the tongue. This beer is pretty terrible.

Aroma: noticeable but not bold, piney hops and bready malt. My nose catches an 'off' smell like vegetable soup being cooked in an institutional kitchen. Mouthfeel: full. Taste: there is something just a little funky here. It doesn't overpower the beer but I notice it in the aroma and taste. Otherwise it is a slightly thin and fairly malty IPA as if they were trying to replicate SN Celebration Ale. Notes: I always try to like Saranac beers, especially as they are brewed a 120 miles from me and their Pale Ale was one of my first entrees into American Craft beer but they usually come up short.

A feather in this brewery's cap has always been head size, retention, and lacing, especially in their hoppier beers. If they could just tweak some flavor notes here and there... Good malty base with a fairly layered hop character, however the hops could be a little softer and more flavorful; the overall impression leans more toward the bitterness and is bordering on harsh.

      "Straight pour from 12oz pry-off bottle to a standard (shaker) pint. Bottling date of October 11, 2011 at 9:38AM if I’m interpreting the Julian Code printed in yellow ink on the neck of the bottle correctly (2841 0938) Appearance (4.0): The pour gave rise to a surprisingly thick, oatmeal-colored head that turned into a 2 ½ extinct volcano kind of crater—thick, flat rim at the top with a shallow indentation in the middle. Body is clear and the definition of amber, a kind of burnt orange-tan. A few rings and spots make for some modest lacing. Not a bad looking beer by any means.  Smell (3.5): There’s something really interesting going on here that smells like super-floral pink grapefruit, if that makes any sense. Unexpected, but very pleasant. Understated toasted biscuit malt base, very simple.  Taste (4.0): Grapefruit pith and a soapy aftertaste dominate the hop profile; bitter but without the edge, sort of. Malt profile is negligible. Yeast, pretty neutral. I wish it was thicker, sweeter and a little darker (I know, that’s what she said, right?) but it’s not bad where it is. It evens out and sweetens a bit as it warms, absorbing the soapiness.  Mouthfeel (3.5): Medium-light bodied and relatively dry in the finish—begs for sessioning.  Overall (4.0): I’d give this a 3.75 if I could, because it’s not quite as good as a 4 but definitely not so mediocre as to deserve a 3.5. Given Saranac’s aim with the hopping here (“This full-flavored ale is triple dry hopped with specialty Citra, Centennial and Cascade hopes to give you a vibrant citrusy hop aroma. The bold hop character is balanced by malt sweetness from English pale and caramel malts . . .” reads the neck label), I feel this would have been a better beer if they just boiled the wort longer, let the hop flavors intensify, stiffen the malt backbone and kick the abv up a notch. Still, this is a good beer for sure, and in a blind test I imagine Saranac haters would be rather surprised.\n",

      "On tap at Cafe D'Alsace and served in a Hoegaarden six sided pint. Bronx Pale Ale pours a hazy rust color, with some nice orange highlights. There's about a finger of bone colored foam crowning the beer. It cuts its height down by half, and then just sits there, before very gradually fading away. Lacing is very nice at the very top of the glass, but falls off a bit further down. The nose has some caramel, as well as citrusy and flowery hop aromas. It's all tilted a little bit too much towards the malty aspect of the beer. This imbalance becomes even more pronounced in the flavor profile, as bitterness and hoppy flavors both take a back seat to the sweet caramel malt base. The body is fairly sturdy, with a carbonation level that falls just a little bit too dull. Bronx Pale Ale feels like it's caught in no man's land, not quite sure whether it's a pale ale or an IPA. It's got the hop profile of the former, but the solid malty presence of a more East Coast interpretation of the latter. While the results of that combination make for a nicely easy drinking beer, they don't make for an especially remarkable American Pale Ale.\n",

      "\"Michigan-grown hops are the story in this seasonal harvest ale. Hopivore is wet-hopped, with hops added to the brew just hours after harvest, creating rare, fresh flavors.\" Brewed in the style of an American Wet Hopped Harvest Ale. Available in 12 oz. bottled 4 packs and limited draft.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a New Holland tulip glass. Served above 47 degrees Fahrenheit. (Appearance) Pours a crisp foamy head of a pale caramel white color over a deep amber body with mild haziness and spritely carbonation. Retention is good and lacing is light and spotty. 4 (Smell) Peppery, herbal and musty hops with a moderate bitterness atop a biscuity and syrupy medium caramel backbone. Fairly unspectacular and difficult to discern this as a wet hopped ale apart from weaker or old dry hopped IPAs due to the mild and depreciated nature of the hop profile. Potency is moderate. 3.5 (Taste) More musty, peppery and dank hops with a mild bitterness atop a biscuity malt with a pinch of grain and caramel bread. Pleasingly reserved on the sweetness of the malt profile for an easy drinking and flavorful malt character, however the hop profile is unusually shallow for a harvest ale. 3.5 (Mouthfeel) Texture is slick, mildly chewy, faintly dry. Carbonation generates a subtle frothiness for a smooth, silky mouthfeel. Body is medium for the style, medium overall. Balance is evenly bitter and sweet. Alcohol presence is mild, no off characters. 3.5 (Overall) Surprisingly unimpressive harvest ale, especially not worth the inflated price tag when you can get superior harvest ales for a fraction of the price. 3.5 New Holland Brewing Company's Hopivore Michigan Wet-Hopped Harvest Ale 3.53/5.00\n",

Thought maybe it came out too cold, but no, kept smelling it as lunch went on, and I didn’t get but the lightest herbal and sweet spice notes, those probably mostly from the hops. A bit of brown sugar also. This is not an intense beer, and I'm afraid those seeking one because of the marketing could be in for a letdown. The main flavors are herbal and sweet spices, including brown sugar. A slightly more magnified version of what the smell offers. It’s just as dependent on the malts as the hops, the malts being nutty and caramel-ish. The letdown here is that the hops don't really shine, and you'd think they would, being \"wet-hopped\" and all that. Partly thanks to this being a draught, the feel was on the soft, smooth and silky side, despite ample carbonation. Almost reached into creamy territory. But probably a shade too thin, really. Made the drinking very easy, and almost disappeared too fast. If there’s one thing that irks me, it’s beers with names like Hopocalypse and Hopsecutioner that don’t obliterate world populations or even rip your head off. The name “Hopivore” doesn’t quite pack such unattainable promises, but it does lead you to think it’s going to be way hoppier than it is.

No? note----after reviewing I did look at other reviews,even going back to the oldest...and even in October there was generally comments that given the labeling with hop cones,the name Hopzilla...you EXPECT....HOPS. Taste/mouth Tastes pretty good if you expect a ESB or a slightly hoppy Amber. The malts give body and some sweets,though not a full on caramel. The whole array of hops,malts,yeasts might have done a lot of nifty shifts,complexity,like it's look alike,Great Lakes Nosferatu,but this does not pull off any special moves. The hops manage a decent finish,a bit muted but with some floral/herbal and not only grapefruit. The malts give a slight syrupy thing,but with very low carbonation and no edge to the flavors..that kind of bogs things down more. Maybe this was a compromise between some sort of English pub ale and a harvest...that was compromised by too little hops in the batch.

The taste was lightly (enjoyably?) hoppy with a definite pine/evergreen bent, but it seemed mild, especially when considered against some of the top beers in the style on this site. Warming, it began to take on an earthy quality, as if English hops had been used in some capacity. It was very easy to drink and I had drank most of it without even thinking. Finish was semi-dry, kind of leaning towards the malt, but still hoppy enough not to be considered sweet. It suddenly dawned on me - it was more of an EPA than an APA!

D: There's nothing awful about this - it's certainly pretty easy to drink. As with every other beer in the Dundee mixed pack (except their forgettable Wheat Beer), it's not bad at all for the price. But that said, it's certainly nothing special.\n",

It almost has a yeasty smell that is certainly not appealing. Flavor is again slightly hoppy but certainly not special. It has a clean malty taste with some hop bitterness. The downside is that it has a strange buttery sweetness too that makes it seem almost creamy.

A little too sweet for me, but still pretty enjoyable. Mouthfeel is light with above average carbonation, a little creaminess - right on for a Extra PA. This beer really isn't anything special, but it is light and easy drinking. Was hoping this to be a little more hop forward like Hop Fish and Red Fish.

Had on tap at BIggie's in Hoboken, NY. 16 oz. pint glass. a - Pours a somehwhat clear golden-orange color with two inches of bright white head and moderate carbonation evident. s - Smells of pale malts, light lemon, and citrus hops, and some bready malts. Not bad but pretty bland nose; not much too it. t - Tastes of citrus hops, lemon, fruity malts, floral hops, bready malts, pale and toasted malts.

      "Enjoyed on draught at Hathaway's Diner on Rt 130. A - It shares a striking semblance with BMC standard fare. It has a slightly darker hue, due to lack of adjuncts and more malt body, and it's not quite as effervescent. This was poured into a tall sexy glass. I felt class drinking from it... even though I was in a diner in Jersey. With a bold continuous head it would get perfect marks for appearance. I wonder if suds aren't to blame. S - There was lots of malt and some uninspiring hops. The aroma wasn't wonderful, like in an IPA or RIS. However it was pronounced enough to suggest the beer has character. It certainly wasn't unpleasant.  T - Lots of pale malt, a little sweet and some crackery dryness. This is a pretty basic beer, but not grainy or trying like a Pilsner. The hops were also more restrained than in a normal Pale Ale, but the bitterness distinguished this as a craft ale. The flavor was subdued, but again enough to add to the taste of the beer. Some citrusy notes, but a PtE clone it is not. M - Comparable to a Yuengling: more body than a Pilsner but more restrained than your favorite Okotberfest. Just enough to be a session beer: neither grainy and unbearable, not heavy and taxing. Really refreshing, but also satisfying. O - This is a true Missionary beer. For the BMC drinkers who thing Yuengling and Sam Adams are specialty beers, and that anything craft if \"heavy\" or \"hoppy\", this beer really opens up the world of possibilities.  If you're looking for a Pliny the Elder or 90 minute IPA in the form of something that you can pound back all night keep walking. However, if you're mature enough to appreciate a beer for drinkability and refinement, here's a go-to ale. Could improvements be made? Sure, some more interesting malts and hallmark American hop varietals would boost this beer to another level. But it's already doing quite well. Really, I think this beer should be considered a Blonde Ale so the Craft Beer community would examine it in a different light.\n",

Golden with a touch of copper in appearance, perhaps a HAIR darker than sierra. S. Suble hop kiss, and caramel malt. Some sweet fruity amber malt as well. This smells a bit less sweet than their amber but otherwise seems the same. The IPA smells a lot better. T. Sweet with some english/american grassy hops. These could be american hops but there's something very english tasting here. The hops finish with enough bite here which the smell and opening taste don't seems to hint at.  D. Goes down easy and would be great on a hot day.  M. A touch light on the carbination. As a result the hops have an almost spice like effect, the body isn't thick or syrupy, but is a very dry finish. I like this but there's something here that's a hair off.  16 dollars for a 6 pack of cans. Thankfully I talked the guy at the store into letting me buy a single but at that price this is a JOKE.

Taste - As with the nose, I get heavy bready caramel malt flavor, light floral hops, and just a hint of citrus. Reading some of the other reviews perhaps this is an older can? I do not get nearly the amount of hop profile as others are describing here; mainly light floral hops. Also, I do get just a tinge of honey at the end.

The flavor was balanced as well, although I thought a little on the bland side. None of the flavors really jumped out at me.

Pours about a finger of head that even as it diminishes leaves a nice creamy cap on top and then devolving to a soapy residue over time. Some bubble action is also clearly visible. Smell - Hops, some caramel and a slight floral undercurrent. Nothing ground breaking bud well executed for what it is. Taste - Good hops bite adding to the bitterness, with slight caramel flavors cutting through that at times. The bitterness is prevalent but not overpowering or completely dominant as some spiciness comes through on the palate, especially in the back half of any given sip and as the beer warms. Mouthfeel - Slightly dry finish, medium carbonation. Spiciness leaves some tingling sensations.  Overall - Very well crafted and one of the best Mill Street has to offer. In a similar vein to the just recently tried distillery ale, however this is far more accessible. An excellent beer for those looking for some hops that turns into a moderately spicy beer, this comes very highly recommended.

      "This brew was served on tap at Toppling Goliath Brewing Company in Decorah, Iowa. It arrived in a tasting stange, showing a ruddy copper coloring. It held a creamy one finger head of soapy white bubbles, showing nice retention. Lacing sat in hollow, mountainous peaks around our glasses. No haze or sediment was noted, and carbonation appeared to be lightly active. The aroma was clean and light, giving off bursts of grapefruity citric and floral hoppiness, crispy and toasty pale and soft amber grain, thin plastics phenols, sweet ethanol, corny adjuncts, nectary fruitiness of apricot and lime flesh, powdery ale yeastiness, white flour, and glassy metallics. The flavoring was much more robust and full, and was composed of sweetly citric grapefruity, grassy, and floral hops, rubber, sea salted seaweed, mildly toasted pale and crystal grain, bittering lemon and lime zest, honeysuckle, corkboard, tin, light muskiness, sawdust, rawhide, and both green and brown grassiness. The body was lightly medium, and the carbonation was medium to high. Each sip gave pleasant slurp, smack, cream, froth, and pop through the mouthfeel, with wet, resinous pucker left lingering on the lips. The abv was appropriate, and drinkability remained high throughout. Overall, here it is, our first beer tasted at Toppling Goliath!! We have been hoping that we’d have the chance to visit them directly, or at least find their beer somewhere someday for quite a while now. Thankfully, some residency interviews in Minneapolis brought us out this way, and we could make it work with our schedule. As a simple house pale ale we were not disappointed. While it is definitely light, especially through the aroma and the feel, the flavoring is bright, sticky, and wonderfully citric with hoppiness. Think of this more as your session pale, is such a thing were to exist. We didn’t want to jump right into PseudoSue when we got there, and felt this was an appropriate stepping stone and transition to get our tasting wheels rolling for the night. Looking back, there is definitely a theme with a lot of their hoppy beers, including a comparable, or even identical yeast, along with a standard pale malt and citric hop used. This was a tasty beer, and a greatly welcomed introduction to the brewery for us.\n",

While the retention is nothing special, it does leave behind some nice lacing as it recedes. All in all, it's a good looking brew. (3.75) Smell: I immediately pick up notes of lemon, grapefruit, flowers, and pine. I could almost call this a lemon bomb, given how pungent is (relative to its gravity, natch). Caramel malt sweetness appears as it opens up. Quite nice for a sessionable pale ale. (3.5) Taste: This is almost like a baby SNPA - flowery hops intermingle with caramel malts. I also get plenty of lemon flavor, mainly on the back end. No wait, this IS a baby SNPA. While it's also just another pale ale (albeit at a lower gravity), it is well done enough to be worthy of my interest. (3.25) Mouthfeel: It has an appropriate heft on the palate - it isn't cripplingly heavy, yet it isn't quite hop water. I don't find it bone dry, but I do find its good carbonation and airy texture refreshing. Drinkability slows down as the fizz fades (and it fades fast), though. (3.25) Overall: It's a fairly typical pale ale, just smaller. And it really isn't bad at all. This would make a decent go to in a craft-deprived location, but I wouldn't choose it over quite a few others.

Prickly at first, with some light syrup, but drying and astringent. Slightly warming. Last of the mixed 12 pack, and the best of the bunch as was rated. The Love was the only failure, I'll have to try it again and hope for a fresher sampling. Grateful was very fresh in aroma and taste. While not as complex as some, there was enough going on to make a very satisfying session.\n",

      "16oz can, dated 07.22.2019, poured into a Trillium Permutation Series stemmed glass. The beer pours a very hazy and turbid orange color, light amber hues with a nice white head, about two fingers tall that has moderate retention and yields a small amount of soapy lacing. The aroma is pleasant, blunt green hops, grassy, lightly fruity and floral, very raw and with a bit of pale dough. The flavors are good, raw green overhop flavor leads the way, pleasantly bitter, grassy, piney with some nice orange peel and wildflower character that brightens the beer up while there is a pleasant doughy grain character with a mineral water forward finish. The mouthfeel is good, a heavier medium body, especially for a pale ale, but it's smooth, crisp and coating with a dry finish. Verdict: A solid pale ale from Trillium. Definitely raw and overhopped as Trillium beers tend to be, but this has a nice and bitter flavor profile that is quite satisfying. A good expression of Columbus but the Mosaic and Citra hops are still able to shine through.\n",

The nose is peach and apricot, pine and citrus. First sip reveals just a second of sweet that leads to white grapefruit and lemon pith, floral notes and finishes with a crispness and a huge bitterness, especially for a pale ale.

      "Once more, the indomitable tone77, my local, in-person trader, comes through with some CANs that I had not even heard of before he dropped the off in furtherance of The CANQuest (TM)! Does anyone else remember Duckpins and Dollars on WBAL-TV (Ch. 11) from Bawlmer, hon? How about CAPT Chesapeake? We were too poor to afford cable when I was a kid, so we had an antenna and rabbit ears and picked up Balto with no problem. I shared this with John Waters when I met him for the first time, in Harrisburg. He threw back his head and remarked that Balto was affecting little kids in PA without even knowing about it, or words to that effect. My brother and my best friend's brother were the big Balto fans when we were growing up, but my Mom-Za did grad school work at Johns Hopkins and my aunt lives in DC and hooked me up with a colleague who was a beer vendor at Memorial Stadium later Camden Yards. As such, I am more connected to Bawlmer than I would have ever imagined, knowing the curator at the Babe Ruth Biramythplace and Museum as well as the BAL and MD Hall of Fame. A picture exists of me holding the Super Bowl V trophy when room to publicly exhibit it did not exist and it was mouldering in a museum basement. I still hate the Browvens as a lifelong Stillers fan, but Balto is always a good, wild time. Onward! From the CAN: \"Smooth &amp; Hoppy [...] That's How We Roll\"; \"A Baltimore Original\"; \"Stay Out of the Gutter Recycle This CAN\"; \"This generously hopped pale ale is a strike in your mouth! Brewed with lots of Pacific Northwest and Southern Hemisphere hops, this beer is ten frames of big citrus and tropical fruit aroma and flavor. A strong malt backbone rounds it out and makes this pale ale a delight for the senses. The pins may be small but the flavor is huge! In our town, we roll Duckpin - a true Baltimore original.\"  Jesus! The Crack revealed a CAN so brimful that there was a) no headspace and b) a spritz across my fingers as a result. I began with an inverted Glug, but I had to back off as the French Vanilla-colored head threatened to overflow the lip of the glass. Upon settling, I had two-plus fingers of head with a creamy aspect to them. Color was a deep-golden shade (SRM = &amp;gt; 7, ~ 9) and as the triumvirate of Mammon, Midas and Croesus fought over a sip, I took note of its clarity. I would like to be able to say \"bright\" since I could see through it, but it had a slight haze that prevents me from saying so. Nose smelled like fresh tropical fruit. I do not know if they still make Tropical Fruit Life Savers, but they, along with Clove Life Savers, were my favorite as a kid. I would tear back the roll to expose each of the five flavors and pop one of each in my mouth to really get a kicky taste. Man, the nose on this took me back - mango, papaya, a slight earthiness, wow! I remember a chica in Trinidad that tasted like this smelled, perhaps as proof that you are what you eat. She subsisted on a diet of fruit, vegetables and seafood and was probably one of the healthiest people with whom I have come in contact. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was really earthy and fruity! Holy ... The CAN mentioned \"citrus and tropical fruit\" and I will grant you tangerines and grapefruit, especially on the finish, but the initial taste was of mangoes and papayas. Wow. Finish was dry, but not like gasping, fish out of water, asthma attack dry. Instead, it was a reminder that I had had liquid in my mouth and now it was gone. Just dry enough to pull me out my reverie. It certainly meets the Cooler Question criteria and especially if I were going bowling, to play bocce or even croquet. I also want to give a nod to \"The Duckpin\", a former squeeze in San Francisco who was built like one. She had not heard the term before I gave her the sobriquet, but she was very happy with it.\n",

A nice two inch hight pillow of white foam then came over the top and settled down qucikly leaving a bare centered crown in its wake. No appreciable side glass lace, but still a more the decent look to it. The aroma was light with hints of light citrus, lemon mostly mixed in on top of a cereal grain filled base. Lots of whaeat and light earthy aromas blending in, but as it warmed a light hop presenced was dulled out way in the back, the aroma overall though was far too light to be really a knockout in any way. A nicel ight, crisp, and clean flavor was then produced. It was a classic light pale ale flavor, clean with a light wheat base, some light floral, citrus notes spprinkled through, orange, light lemon grass, especially in the finish.

Plenty of cascade hop character is present with a leafy, grassy citrus hop character, along with a mild aspirin note as well. Some caramel is present, along with a candied citrus sweetness.  The palate opens with a juicy hoppiness and citrus peel and citrus pith. Oranges and grapefruit are most noticeable, again in that classic Cascade hop character. Some sweetness is present in the mid-palate, with just a wee bit of toffee, burnt sugar to go with the caramel. Unfortunately, this beer is just too thin and watery, especially on the finish, where there's some chalky malt, mild hop bitterness and no real hop flavor lingering.

It's not scary or difficult. It's just a well-balanced, well-hopped pale ale. It's relatively light with good lemony bitter notes. It looks really good in the glass, light orange with yellow highlights, a good sticky head and some fun suspension. The nose is a tad weak but good when it comes through. It's fresh and sweet with a crisp citric tone. The taste is similar. Lemony hops and light malt mix well into a good, calm beer. Feel can get a bit watery, especially with my palette still bracing from the relatively recent spate of fall DIPAs. The beer is quite drinkable.

      "A 355ml can with a BB of Jan 2014. Picked up recently from Trembling Madness in York. A pale ale for winter.... Poured into a straight pint glass. A clear brownish-amber hue with low carbonation. Yields a large head of creamy white foam that lasts for a few minutes before subsiding to a surface layer. Nice lacing. Aroma of pine, subtle weed, peel, grass/hay, sweet caramel malt and earthy yeast. Hoppy and nicely balanced. Tastes of intense aromatic hops and sweet malt, with a spicy bitter finish. Notes of pine resin, dank weed, orange peel, mild grapefruit, citrus, grass/hay, white pepper, caramel, earthy yeast and stewed hops. Slightly sweet, followed by a resinous bitterness upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth and tingly, with mild carbonation and decent body. Hop oils stimulate the tongue. Somewhat astringent, accompanied by an aftertaste of pine resin, bitter aromatic hops and faint caramel. Good stuff - my only real complaint is that it isn't particularly pale. More like an American 'bitter'. Looks OK, colour notwithstanding. The aroma and flavour are distinctly hop-driven, with a subtle malt backbone to provide balance. Decent body; carbonation could be enhanced to add texture. While I don't find the style to be especially suited to winter, it is a deliciously drinkable brew. Worth a punt if you come across it.\n",

Taste is very balanced -- not sweet or especially hoppy, appealing to mutliple moods without beeing bland or innocuous. Not a knock-your- socks-off ale, but very fine without a single disappointing or cloying feature.

      "Pours nice and creamy from the can, the head is especially soft and smooth. It's a copper color with quite a bit of sediment floating around the glass. Head retention and lacing are very good.  There's not too much aromatic intensity fuming from the beer, but a crisp assertive hop character is certainly present. Grapefruit, mint, and grass are the most obvious flavors. The malt is subtle, with fleeting whiffs of oats and caramel.  Intensity is boosted that extra notch in the taste, which is greatly appreciated because it has excellent flavor. At first sip, sharp grapefruit and resiny cannabis flavors strike the taste buds. There's not too much sweetness coming from the malt, just a bit of caramel, yet more sugary citrus and bubblegum flavors from the hop side of things help to even things out. The toasty backbone of the beer looms in the shadows, but is always present. It's not balanced 50/50 but, but there's enough malt intensity to hold a candle to that bold complex hop character.  The feel is nice and resiny, and the body on the medium side. Carbonation is very crisp, and it all finishes dry. So easy to drink. This beer sure has a load of flavor, not at all skimp on the hops either, satisfying for sure.\n",

M: Medium, slight creaminess, especially as it warms up a bit.  D: Very, very drinkable. Unlike most of the other winter ales in which I dabble in on a regular basis, this has a lower alc content, however there is not a lack of flavor in any way.

From an American Pale Ale you'd expect more hops and a little more excitement in the beer. I think it's too sweet and trying to be a cross between English and American style pale ale but not getting neither quite right. I'm very shocked at the ratings on this one.

      "6-pack purchased at Argonaut Liquor in Denver, CO earlier today. 12 fl oz can format with standard pull-tab top. Blue, white, and black label. 6% ABV. Pale ale. HEAD: White in colour. Occupies ~50% of my Sam Adams perfect pint glass with ~11cm of head. Frothy, soft in appearance, inviting. Retention is excellent - ~10+ minutes. BODY: A little cloudy, actually, but transparent and translucent. Pale copper colour of average vibrance. No yeast/lees are visible within. Appears well-carbonated. It's not a unique or special appearance for a pale ale, but it's generally inviting. AROMA: I believe the kids would refer to this as \"dank.\" Tropical, floral, grassy, fruity. Hits diverse hop aromatics, nailing everything except pine, juiciness, and resin. Tropical fruit dominates, evoking mango and maybe tangerine. Pale malt aromatics suggest the hop bitterness is well-balanced by malty sweetness, but I don't find any overly sweet caramalt or crystal malt aromatics. An inviting aroma of limited pungency that suggests a balanced and enjoyable yet straightforward pale ale. I'm looking forward to trying it. Aromatic intensity is above average. TASTE &amp; TEXTURE: Hoppy yet balanced, bringing tropical fruit: mango and tangerine, primarily. There're some floral hop flavours as well, but no pine, resin, juice, grapefruit, or overt citrus. Some scratchy bitterness does tag along with the hop flavours, and the mouthfeel gets too scratchy and coarse, dragging on the palate a bit and making the beer a little parching instead of refreshing. But it's aptly light to medium-bodied, boasts apt carbonation, and doesn't suffer from any harshness, astringency, booziness, oiliness, etc. Backbone is all pale malt. I don't find any overly sweet caramalt or crystal malts. Balance needs dialing in, but there's enough hop flavour here even if it wants for more depth of flavour and expressiveness/vividness. I do like it in a general sense, but the flavour profile isn't in clear focus, it doesn't amount to a gestalt whole of a beer, and the mouthfeel is troublesome. Not a juicy or refreshing pale ale, but rather an aggressive and challenging one that sacrifices drinkability in favour of hop bitterness. OVERALL: Far from a great expression of the style, but not a bad brew by any means - even if it's a bit too aggressive to be labelled \"pleasant\" or \"enjoyable.\" Indeed, it's rather unapproachable for a pale ale, coming off feeling like a beer that wanted to be an IPA but didn't want to commit. If the mouthfeel weren't as flawed as it is, this might be solid work; its hop build is interesting enough. But that dragging scratchiness is tough to get past, and as a result I wouldn't recommend this to others - even if I'll enjoy working through the sixer I bought in spite of the beer's obvious textural issues. Finally, it's worth saying what's obvious from the get-go - this is just too bitter for a pale ale. C (2.84) / AVERAGE *** 05.31.17 2nd impression: Low C+ / ABOVE AVERAGE\n",

      "a seattle institution - when i came to seattle, i was told to order both this and mac and jack's african amber - neither of which impressed. i get the feeling that they are the \"good beer\" that's on tap at anywhere in the seattle area, much like there's a one-off bell's offering anywhere in ann arbor, or back in downstate illinois there will be a sam adams lager. nothing special, but if the option is between this and BMC beers, manny's it is.\n",

      "Golden amber, slightly hazy look. Good smell of citrus and oily hops. But this is not a big hop bomb. Its very well balanced, a nice crisp but smooth hop, with some nice malt balance that finish very crisp and light. A great match for food, especially the fried oysters I had in Seattle. This beer is proof that every APA from the NW doesn't have to be a big hop explosion, but rather a nice clean American Ale.\n",

      "Manny's Pale Ale is the best brewed micro beer I have ever tried. Georgetown Brewery has done a wonderful job with this one. Available in a lot of local eateries, pubs, etc, and can be purchased there at the brewery in Georgetown, South Seattle. Appearance: Beautiful! Rustic amber coloring with a light head that provides a great lacing as you drink it down.  Smell: Crisp, light hop and sweet malty aroma. A slight tang smell in the background, denoting a tad bit of sweetness but nothing but picture perfect! Taste: A wonderfully balanced brew with a hit of bitterness in the beginning that fades away into light malt...then the bites comes back at the end, leaving a citrus, hoppy, pure taste behind.  Mouth feel: Crisp and lively, medium body brew with light carbonation. A nice creamy feel at the end.  Drinkability: A perfectly brewed beer. PERFECT!! Good session beer and could accommodate most food courses. Strongly recommend trying it, especially if you live in WA State.\n",

      "not that pseudosue needed anything done to it, but this just makes it a bit more well rounded, bold, and memorable. the citra on its own is less versatile (or so i thought until i just had the king sue...), so the galaxy here really helps give it a boost, a little more bitter, a little more pungent, especially on the aroma. galaxy lends more nuanced citrus, limes and grapefruits, as well as a slight pineapple juice complexion. the base beer seems super light, so this really is all about the hops. dramatic even, i think this is about the hops complexion most breweries are going for in these new school pales and ipas these days, these guys just have it so dialed in. its also a lot better than any of the recent pseudosue that has been coming in cans out of florida, it just hasnt been the same, so maybe its as much the bomber from iowa as it is the galaxy dry hopping, its been awhile since i had a bomber of this base beer, but its so fresh and exploding with the hops. in my opinion, galaxy and citra together here is better than citra in isolation. if i could have a steady supply of this, i might not ever pick up a different dry hopped pale ale... its that good!\n",

      "16oz pint at Olympic tavern Half acre tap takeover. Appearance: Opaque golden body with white head. lots of lacing left behind after each sip.  Smell: clean orange sweet citrus nose with light catty and dank hops. Fruity and floral. Hint of grass. Really nice hop profile in this pale ale. Hint of light bready malt. Taste: Much similar to the nose. Lots of sweet orange citrus notes and a hint of catty dankness. Light bitterness from the hops. Fruity and floral. A nice juicy quality from the hops that is reminiscent of top tier east coast hoppy beers.  Mouthfeel: On the lighter end of a medium bodied beer or the high end of a light beer. Which ever you think is more accurate. Moderate carbonation levels with a creamy carbonation noted. Feels juicy and wet while still being flavorful and sessionable. Overall: This is definitely my favorite beer from Half Acre; it is easily better than daisy cutter and double daisy cutter. Haven't seen this on the shelf before, but one thing is for sure that this would be a fantastic hot weather beer come summer time especially drinking it from a tallboy. Really nice combo of hops and the fact that it reminds me of east coast hoppy beers with that awesome juicy hoppyness character really put this over the top. This is a local gem!\n",

      "Serving type: 16 oz can into a shaker pint Pours a golden yellow color with the slightest of haze. Smells of slight resin, citrus zest, genetic hoppiness, along with faint tropical hops. Taste is improved over the smell. Initial resin and grass flavors lead into citrus flavors and bitterness. Finishes crisp and clean. Feel is light and amply carbonated which helps the lighter flavors in this beer. Overall this is a very good pale ale with good flavors and aromas that make it especially refreshing during this 100+ degree Southern California summer.\n",

      "Pale yellow, hazy brew topped with a very fluffy snow-white head. Good retention and wide, thin fields of lacing. Lots of center-glass carbonation. Big hop aroma immediately upon uncapping. Bright, indistinguishably fruity hops; light dank sweetness, tobacco, and earth; honey; straw; light caramel and bready malts. Light but full-flavored, sweet, and incredibly dank on the mid- and back-end. Vague tropical fruits, honey, biscuit and bread, tobacco. Surprisingly medium bodied, not quite chewy, but still drinkable. No sting, not particularly lively, but not flat either. Easily the most full-bodied and flavorful \"session\"-level APA or IPA I've had. I'm not 100% on board with the hop profile, but it gives it a huge, interesting kick, and is well-worth seeking out, especially for fans of Mosaic and Citra hops (of which this beer is reminiscent).\n",

      "I was skeptical at first, because I wasn’t sure if they used those syrups or not. But when I saw that it was Dogfish Head I figured that they would make a legit beer using the hop characteristics. This is a 6.5% ABV and 25 IBU pale ale. Look-It pours a dark copper gold like buckwheat honey, but has a very distinctive pink hue. It almost glows pink above the base colors. Even the head had a pink tint to it.  Smell-I get strong notes of bubblegum and citrus. It has a slight aroma of honeysuckle pistils as well.  Taste-It tastes like guava, dragon fruit rind, passionfruit, horned melon rinds, and prominent malts based on some sort of honey or roasted grain. It has a medium body and ample carbonation. The bite from the alcohol pairs nicely with the hop resins and alpha acids which then mix with the citrus and exotic fruit palate.  Overall-I’d say this is a very unique beer that was worth the cash. I’d probably stick to drinking it on special or rare occasions only. It’s an easy-drinker and has a lot of flavors to pick up on with each sip. There is a hop resin that coats your tongue and begs you to take another refreshing sip. Cheers, folks!\n",

Drinkable and refreshing, especially while outside on a warm Houston evening.\n",

      "Look: Golden towards yellow in color; completely transparent. Lots of medium bubbles visible. Pours was a large 3 finger head that dies down leaving an uneven thin layer of foam on the surface of the beer. Some lacing on the sides of the glass. Smell: Not much in terms of aroma; mild grassy - malt scent. Taste: Malt, mild grain flavor, extremely mild hoppy taste. Tastes like a good quality commercial light ale; similar to a lager in taste. Not bad, but nothing spectacular. Feel: Thinner body. Mild carbonation provides a slight fizzy sensation. Mild, dry finish but not overly dry; refreshing. Overall: A decent lighter-bodied ale, but nothing special. Would be good on a hot day. I would drink again, but probably will not purchase again only because there are so many better beers out there.\n",

Best I can say here is that I liked it, but pale ales don't really blow me away. I didn't taste much of the hops. M - A little thin for me. It went down really quickly, which can be good and bad.

Leaves a frothy film, thick collar and thick sheeting, spots, bands and major blobs of lacing. Nice looking beer. Somebody mentioned a buttery popcorn note on the nose and this is definatly on point. I dont recall another beer with a popcorn nose! I do also get some leafy, herbal hop notes. On the palate, I get some herbal hops again, light citric fruit, a hint of smoke perhaps. Light and refreshing pale ale, perhaps a bit thin and watery, but not bad and fairly enjoyable stuff. Nothing special, but sessionable and likely would be nice on a warm summers day with some cheese, bread and salads.  Nice that more and more decent beers are being canned.

N: mostly bready and yeasty up front, also get some citrus as the glass warms a bit. T: Very good, very approachable. Starts with some bready malty character that is soon followed by a subtle hop bitterness. A little bit of citrus zest in there as well. M: Crisp, light bodied, good carbonation, no complaints at all but nothing exceptional. O: This is actually a very good beer. I have to admit I've been skeptical about the cans, but so far Baxter has made a great impression on me. Currently the average score on this beer is 79, and I think that's way too low. This beer is certainly comparable to SN Pale Ale (which has a rating of 'exceptional'). Pamola Xtra Pale is an approachable beer, and I highly recommend it. I will be drinking more of it, especially in the summer, and I'll be shipping some to friends in SoCal as well.\n",
