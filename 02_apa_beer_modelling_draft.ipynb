      "Waited to try this beer for years and then kind of forgot about it. Suddenly it appears on local shelves. It is pretty good for only having the terrible Citra hop being used (I am sorry but Psuedo Sue is terrible). I would describe this as the original juicy pale ale before the haze craze came along. It also has the benefit of having bitterness and not being overly sweet. Would I drink this regularly? Probably not as I am more in the pine, herbal, earthy, dank spectrum with hoppy beers.\n",

      "Appearance: Pours a glowing, but not bright,orange/amber color like an ember from a dying campfire. Aroma: Strong citrus aroma of mandarin orange, ripe pineapple, grapefruit. A dank pine forest. Flavor: Tons of nice mandarin orange, grapefruit, ripe pinapple with a dank and resiny pine flavor. A somewhat sweeter honey (maybe toffee?) bread malt body follows. A wave of bitterness finishes on the end.  Feel: Medium body, but a heavier mouthfeel. It captures the IPA level of hop flavor bitter astringency on the tongue, but follow with the perfect amount of malt sweetness to leave you wondering whether it's bitter, sweet, or both. Overall, though its dry on the tongue.  Compared to PsuedoSue: This one has a darker amber color. It has more dank and earthy notes. Not as airy. Less piney. A stronger bitterness. Much heavier bodied and more resiny. Not quite as smooth. Leans more toward an IPA. Overall: An top shelf beer. I was initially blown away by the bitterness on the nose, yet when tasted it has such a strong malt balance to counteract that. It's the perfect balanced pale ale here and I'm not sure whether it finishes bitter or sweet. I think that's what makes it finish so well and would rate this pale ale as a top not because of that. I think it pioneered the style of west-coast IPA,\n",

Aroma: Dank, super resinous, and grassy, with a touch of citrus rind  Taste: Moderate malt sweetness, mostly caramel but also with a touch of cracker. A sharp bitterness rises with only.a hint of citrus and resin Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with carbonation on the Light side Finish: Dry and resinous in the tongue. Strong residual bitterness leads over malt, building intensity after the swallow.  Overall: Prototype for an original American Pale Ale/IPA. The bitterness and malt character seem on the strong end for an APA. Definitely has a stronger malt base reflective of the traditional style as opposed to the newer evolution of the style. Clean and crisp with a nice dank and resinous hop character\n",

      "So, let's dispense with the BS that this is an APA - it's an IPA - and a damn good one! Pours a light copper with over a finger of head. The nose is piney with dank notes as well. The flavor profile has a strong malt backbone with hoppy bitterness that is amped up to a Spinal Tap 11. Nice and resiny too. The real magic of this offering is that it is only 6.2% but it has the bold flavor of an 8-10% DIPA. I only wish that it were more readily available here in Eastern PA.\n",

The smell is a potpourri of floral notes, as well as citrus from tangerine and an orange juice quality to grapefruit and pineapple with a hint of papaya and mango. A touch of pine on the nose from the Citra hops, as well as a malty, cake batter or light vanilla sweetness to it. Up front, it’s earth and green with a mild hop dankness to it. The beer opens up with bready and caramel body with a slight tropical fruit note of pineapple and mango. Zombie Dust has a clean and crisp mouthfeel to it, with a resiny and bitter, but dry finish to it. Could drink this beer all day long.\n",

      "Really grateful to FBarber for hooking me up with this highly acclaimed beer via trade. I had it once on tap as a nightcap. Let’s see what it tastes like on a fresh palate. Pours an amber color with an orange hue. light haze and moderate head that displays good retention. It’s not the most special looking beer ever, but the appearance does hint at a solid body. The aroma opens with a delicious burst of citrus and tropical fruit. Notes of tangerine, freshly squeezed orange juice, grapefruit, pineapple, mango, papaya and even a hint of banana. Aromas of caramel malt foresee a solid malt base to come. Amidst all of this, a wonderful pungent layer of herbal aromas, pine, grass and dank, delight the nose. From the start, the taste opens up with earthy hops flavors, piny, resiny and dank. The palate opens dry with a significant yet clean bitterness. Flavors begin to open up, particularly the interplay between malts and hops. A firm bready and caramel malt backbone adds body, roundness and moderate sweetness. A juicy burst of citrus fruit, grapefruit rind, orange pith, and a touch of lemon fills the palate. Also, notes of tropical fruit, pineapple and mango compliment the malts and other hops flavors. Delightfully sublime taste overall, supremely balanced and dynamic. Medium bodied, moderately carbonated and smooth overall. Resiny, bitter and dry finish begs for more sips. I could crush multiple bottles. This beer is a true work of art. Finely crafted and supremely balanced. I don’t buy into all of this nonsense that its time has come and that newer beer trends have surpassed it. This magical elixir is, simply put, a delicious classic that has the ability to stand the test of time and outlast passing fads. Well worth the hype!\n",

      "Appearane-The beer pours a nice orange-amber color that has a little bit of haze and a one finger head of pure white foam. The head fades fairly fast leaving a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell- The aroma is heaviest of citrus hops of tangerine and orange and has lots of tropical fruit aromas that blend with the citrus nicely. Along with these smells are other hop notes of earth and a light herb. Some bread and caramel are in there as well and produce a fruity and inviting aroma overall. Taste- The taste begins sweet and malty with lots of dough and a ton of fruit, with tangerine, orange, pinapple, mango, and papya all there. The hop is mainly of a citrus nature upfront, which while initially somewhat light, grows stronger as the taste advances. Along with the increase in citrus hop, so to comes other more dank hop tastes of pine and earth. With a bit of a surge of sweet, as a modest candied sugar taste and more fruit come at the very end, one is left with a sweet and malty but nicely citrus and moderately dank hopped flavor to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel- The body of the brew is thick and chewy with a carbonation level that is moderate. For the mix of sweet, hop, and fruity malt the feel is great and makes a great drinker. Overall- A very tasty beer!! It has a great drinkability with tons of fruity flavor and a very enjoyable hop blend. I can see why this beer has a good reputation and is one to try if you get a chance.\n",

      "*The quality of this beer can vary a good deal batch to batch. Three Floyds Zombie Dust Pale Ale - 6.2% ABV - 50 IBUs Date: 08/01/18, consumed on 08/27/18. Appearance: Murky burnt orange with a finger of sudsy eggshell colored head. The head retention is better than most Pale Ales, it really sticks around.  Aroma: Grapefruit and tons of it, pine, and orange aromas dominate but the malts are more assertive as well, presenting a light bread crust like backbone.  I am also getting faint hints of like mango in syrup. Some dank resinous aroma comes through as well, although it isn’t anything overwhelming. In short, this smells very nice, very aromatic with a bright citrusy hop aroma.  Taste: Right off the bat, you get a big blast of grapefruit that washes over the palate. The other thing that is immediately noticeable is that Zombie Dust drinks fairly bitter for being a 50 IBU pale ale. The malts here have a bit of that sweeter syrup quality to them rather than the bread like notes of the nose. It's not unlike a malt profile of say, an 8% beer with 80 IBUs. Having said that, Zombie Dust is very drinkable, not too heavy or reliant on the malts in the least. For as bold and out of balance as this one might sound, the opposite is actually true. Much like the balance of aromas, Zombie Dust achieves a almost absurdly balanced taste as well. For me, this one skirts the line between a pale ale and an IPA. At times it seems like an 8% IPA flavor wise, yet it's so easy drinking that most would be able to session two or three of these without issue. As the beer warms, some of that sweet mango and tangerine flavors come to the forefront. It is a really nice flavorful beer and worth the $13 price tag.  Biased comments: Zombie Dust is a really nice beer, but I feel the reputation it has is somewhat overinflated. I happily admit that it is the best and most flavorful lower ABV pale ale I have had and those seeking a more grapefruit forward pale ale or lighter end IPA should look no further. However, considering the hoops often required just to get a six pack, Zombie Dust, for me, often falls in favor of shelf beers like Alpha King or a Stone Brewing IPA.\n",

      "Two plus finger head of light tan to cream white, extremely thick and barely moves for some time, the lacing slowly tears off from the head, more random splotches than streaks. Dark bronze orange colored liquid, faint haze, the bubbles are tiny but swirl upwards with rapidity. Malts ground the nose with mocha, dark chocolate to challah bread notes, then spiced oranges, pine cone, tarry earth and just cut onions, leafy dankness, oddly the papaya, nectarine, pear scents never really factor in and it might be easy to not even notice this element. Full-bodied, creamy texture, fills the mouth from cheek to cheek, borderline heavy. The carbonation is a little better than average but not especially refreshing. Loaded with honeyed tangerine to grapefruit citrus as well as sticky pine sap, in turn the Saltine cracker and charred pizza crust notes substantial. Malted milk balls, bitter chocolate with less intense caramel. Much more floral at the finish and retronasally. The apricot, peach, pineapple, pear fruit remains lowkey but consistent in that. Smooth for its weight and the relatively low ABV helps drinkability. Worth seeking out.\n",

Absolutely love this beer.\n",

Pours a light, clear orange gold with a smattering of lacing that persists. Good level of carbonation. Smell is dank, oniony mixed with ripe melon. Hints of cracker and bread malt and yeast aroma as well. Taste is wonderfully hop-forward with great depth of bitterness and flavor from the Citra. I pick up hints of pine and citrus, but mostly ripe tropical fruit in the taste. Malt is there but takes a backseat to the hop show. This is a really nice pale ale and would love to have it more often.\n",

Lemon, lemongrass, pine sap, dish soap, light biscuit, and dank hay on the nose. Maybe a little tropical citrus, some herbal greens, and a pilsner malt-like note in the background. Taste is bright, bitter citrus pith balanced by a wave of semi-dry fruit sweetness. Lots of lemon, grapefruit, berry, white grape, and resin. Crackery malt with a touch of salt. Dry, white wine finish with a wonderful, lingering grapefruit bitterness aftertaste. Unbelievably drinkable. Soft, well-carbonated, silky feel. Hefty body than you'd expect on a 6% beer, but certainly not sticky or heavy. Nice coating quality that helps that grapefruit pith finish last even longer.\n",

Not see through but not hazy.  The smell is dank with citrus, pine, resin. Dank.  The taste brings the pine to the front and translations into some stone fruit. Dank.  The mouthfeel is light, perfect for the summer. Not too thick or cloying for the style. Sticky.  Overall, I honestly think this is still the best citra exclusive pale ale. Convince me otherwise.\n",

      "Courtesy of @FFFjunkie. Bottled 9/11/2017 and poured into 3 Floyds pint glass. It pours a hazy, orange-amber with a finger plus of fluffy, ecru-colored head that resembles gelato, and thick, elegant lacing that never dissipated. It's a beautiful pour. The nose is primarily malty with lemon peel, grapefruit, lots of pine, and aromatic hops. It's dank and decidedly bitter with abundant biting Citra hops but there's also a noticeable flavor of sweet malt and there is also subtle lemon and pineapple, particularly as the glass warms. It finishes with pepper notes. For an APA, it has a creamy, viscous mouth feel with lively carbonation. And with a temperate ABV of 6.2%, it's a very easy drinker. Overall, Zombie Dust is simply an exquisite Pale Ale; one of the best I've ever had. And it's a nice throwback inasmuch as it doesn't rely on a lot of tropical fruit. This is brewing at its best!

      "Bottled 16 days ago and had alongside a 3.5-week-old can of PseudoSue. L -- Pours a pale golden color with the slightest bit of haze and a 2-finger head produced with moderately aerated pour. Some retention and good lacing. S -- Pineapple, earth, candied grapefruit, papaya, mango, cannabis, and a hint of that rubber hops smell too T -- Big earthy and grassy flavors upfront, rounded out by cracker malts and hints of tropical fruit and dank pine resin F -- Nice, well-rounded mouthfeel, especially given the fairly low ABV. Crisp and refreshing. Medium carb and medium mouthfeel. Finishes dry with a restrained bitterness O -- My main complaint with this and all other citra-centric beers I've had is that the aromas and flavors are heavy on the grassy/earthy characteristics. I'm personally more of a fruit-forward hop guy (galaxy and mosaic topping my list), and I think I subconsciously equate any sort of harsh grassiness with 'old'. Still, this is an absolute joy to drink and I'm glad to have located a bottle during a five hour train layover in Chicago 87/100\n",

      "Look - a slightly opaque golden orange with a one-finger white head that sticks around and has decent lacing throughout. Smell - dank pungent hops are front and center, but you also get a nice array of hop aromas in the form of citrus (grapefruit, lemon, orange) and floral notes. There are also some sweet notes lingering in the background that might be caramel malts. Taste - very similar to the nose in that dank resin, earthy hops are very powerful, but it's balanced with the lighter side of the hop spectrum since the citrus and floral notes (like mentioned above) shine through. Again, there's a slight malty presence in the form of caramel and bread, but these notes are almost completely overpowered by the thick hop characteristics.  Feel - high carbonation, medium body, sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is definitely an interesting example of the style. It tastes more like an imperial IPA, but it still maintains aspects of a lighter, refreshing pale ale. It's a hop bomb for sure, which isn't exactly my thing anymore, but I would absolutely jump at the chance to have this again.\n",

      "Red-amber in color, with very good clarity. Topped with a pale tan head. Good lacing and duration. Resiny hop character up front on the nose, this beer is part old school Microbrew tradition of the West Coast style and part new school innovation, with a good mess of different hops used. Not quite “dank”, but flowery and herbal (more on that in the taste). Clean ale character and some biscuit malt on the nose. On the first sip it’s sweet, smooth, slightly sharp and tangy. Bitterness is restrained but sturdy; This used to be one of the most bitter U.S. ales in the pale ale -to- IPA range, but was eclipsed over the past twentysomething years. Bitterness lingers and blends with a bittersweet undertone, along with very prominent herbal character. The one herbal note I’m getting now (and bear in mind that I haven’t enjoyed this regularly in close to twenty years) is of damiana, or diviner’s sage. If you’ve never partaken of damiana, it’s a pungent and sweet herb, and though I doubt that FFF would’ve ever brewed with it, maybe they did partake? An interesting note at any rate, and adds depth of flavor to the ale. Good drinkability, albeit a bit fuller in flavor and character than a good many lower strength examples in the very broad American Pale Ale style. A very, very good beer overall. Canned 6/19/19 — less than three weeks ago.\n",

      "Appearance: Pours a hazy, pure copper color with a foamy, and lacy head that lingers. Aroma: Strong aromas of citrus, tropical melon and stonefruit. A typical newer American simcoe or mosaic hop profile Flavor: Taste follows the nose. Strong flavors of citrus, tropical melon, stonefruit. This is followed by a strong hop bitterness to round out the flavor. Yet, not enough to completely clean the strong bready and slightly caramel malty sweetness that comes through underneath at the end. Finishes neither sweet nor dry. The perfect touch at the end. Finish: Moderate carbonation. Heavily bodied. Strong malt sweetness to balance the bitterness that comes through at the end. Finishes perfectly smooth.  Compared to the old-school Sierra Nevada Pale Ale: This one has more new-age American hops. Centennial and Warrier. Pungent and dank tropical melon are present. Less grapefruit and pine. Strongly bitter like an IPA, yet it finishes with a sweet bread and slightly caramel malt profile that stands up to the bitterness to define the pale ale name. Overall: This represents the new American standard of a pale ale. Newer-age American hops profile. Much more robust. Balanced perfectly with the malts. You think you're drinking an IPA, but then the sweeter malts come through for such a nice finish. The best classification of new-American hops I can think of. The citrus and tropical flavors are so strong and wonderful. I understand why you wouldn't pick a favorite beer after this one. This is a top notch quality beer.\n",

      "A - Pours a nice amber/golden color with a nice white head. S - Great citrus and hop notes. Maybe some pineyness in there. T - Excellent blend of pine/orange/dankness/hops. M - Light/medium bodied, aftertaste was excellent with lasting hops/citrus flavor. O - Excellent execution of an APA, but the stand-out aspect for me was the citrus profile. This was hands-down the best orange/citrus flavor that I've ever tasted in a beer. Most PA's have a (IMHO) fatal flaw in the citrus profile where it is either too bitter/sweet/distorted/muted/sour to rank high on my list. This may not make it fantastic for others, but in my book it makes it shine. Buy more (and more) for sure.\n",

The nose comes across as fruity, tropical, and maybe sweet---but in a bubblegum kind of way---combined with some very faint dankness. The flavor is remarkable in balance---it's bitter, tart, and malty all in equal measure. There's an alcohol bite at the end, that kind of unfolds across the palate. All told, a superior contribution to the IPA canon.\n",

The taste also starts with big citrus- orange, grapefruit, lime, lemon, malt, pine- especially on the finish. A good amount of hop bitterness up front, the malt tames it thereafter.

The nose starts massively hoppy, sharp and peppery, fading off into prominent peach and sweet caramel. Taste is straight-on malt forward, sweet toasted grains and caramelized corn syrup.

Aromas are really wonderful, with huge citrus and big tropical fruit, but not the overripe, overly sweet kind. Grassy, but not overly so, with a little pine and some nice white wine notes. Really well done. Flavors are a bit of a watered down version of the above. Citrus, slightly underripe tropical fruit, light berry, very grassy, little bit of dankness, and a strong mineral note. Quite good, but a bit of a let down after the nose. Bit thin, feel-wise. Quite silky and smooth, but the body is just a touch watery. Honestly not sure how this is an APA versus an IPA, but whatever.

Nose is fruity, hoppy, floral, sweetness, some hoppy notes, and a little bit of dankness. Taste is sweet. More citrus than anything but you do get some tropical fruit and that floral and herbal note. Good bitterness and works well with the pithy grapefruit you get also. Well carbonated with a light mouth feel, finishing on the dry side. This was more like an IPA. Not a Pale Ale. The flavors are a bit subdued, but deceptively so. It'll grow on you the longer you sip and savor. Very well balanced. Not as refreshing as a Dales Pale, or SN's Pale Ale, but it's a great beer which I think has been mis termed as a pale ale. It's not really in that style.

      "Look: Pours a hazy pale orange color with a massive, foamy head that lingers. Looks like a NEIPA. Aroma: Strong aromas of citrus. Mostly unripened pineapple, peach, and pine. Lemon, mango, &amp; grapefruit are there for support. It's not quite your airy NEIPA because it has a hint of herbs and tropical dankness. Little to no earthiness. It's bitter unripened pineapple in a pine forest. Flavor: The flavor follows those nose. Slightly sweeter, but still the pineapple, peach, lemon and grapefruit. Also some mild herbal quality clove, banana, or onion. A pale malt sweetness follows the citrus for a nice finish. A mild lingering bitterness on the tongue. Body: Medium bodied and well carbonated. Feels light and crisp though. Just enough body and sweetness to satisfy, but incredibly smooth. First it's so light you think it's going to finish like juice, but then has just enough carbonation and malt to create a pillowy and light smoothness that you hardly know it's there. Compared to Zombie Dust: This is lighter colored and bodied. It has a much more light citrus, pine, and herbal quality. More pine flavor but less bitter. Lighter bodied and more balanced in terms of herbs, citrus, and pine. Really well-rounded. Overall: A very east-coast style citra-dry hopped pale ale. Delicious. Drinks like juice, but has just enough hop bitterness and body to be so much more. This is the NEIPA before there was a NEIPA. Of the Zombie Dust, Surley X-tra Citra, and this, this one is my choice. The balance and smoothness is unmatchable.\n",

Not west coast, not NEIPA, but original and well developed beer. L: Hazy S: Grassy and pine notes with big citrus. The pine has a bit more depth with additional spice notes, some doughy lingering sweetness.  T: fruit forward but more development. There is an even balance of the ingredients. Hoppy notes of citrus an slightly danky pine, with dough and malt note rounding the experience.  F: This might be my favorite part. This just sits well. Not overwhelming,not light, just a pleasant warming feeling of excellence.  O: Just an amazing well developed great beer. Development comes from experience and a real love for attention to details.

      "This is certainly one of the highest-rated APAs on BA, and it's one I've wanted for a long while. Thanks to TG's expansion into the MA market, I hope to be able to pick it up fairly regularly because... it's awesome! I'm not surprised, but it's always good to feel vindicated for personal high hopes based upon the BA community's reverence for a particular brew. In other words: when something lives up to the BA hype, I become further convinced this is the very best beer community on the Internet! This pours an insanely hazy, nearly-opaque orange color with a dollop of creamy head that seems to last for quite a while before sinking to approximately a finger-and-a-half in my glass. It leaves behind solid lace and some sticky, inconsistent lace. The surface is almost fully-obscured, with some bubbles congregating in small pockets. From what I can tell, this bears a fair-moderate carbonation, but the streams are not easy to notice considering the haze. The nose here is wonderfully dank and citrusy with moderate notes of sweet tropical fruit, ranging from ripe mango to papaya and passion fruit. Super juicy smelling with complementing pine resin and dank, grassy, green elements that really shock my senses. As soon as I opened this one, I had to put my nose to the aluminum can to deeply inhale and indulge in the aroma I knew this would produce... my response was no less than an audible proclamation of \"fuuuuck,\" and I knew I would be in good hands. The flavor is chock-full of ripe citrus and mango, with flashes of dankness and slight green onion. Grapefruit rind and papaya crossed with unfiltered/pulp-laden orange juice washes over the palate, providing waves upon waves of intense juicy hop goodness. The malt profile seems slightly dextrin-heavy, keeping things firmly planted on the heavier-bodied side of the APA style (this drinks more like an XPA/Extra Pale Ale than an APA... kind of between an APA and IPA in bitterness/flavor/feel), lending a bit of biscuity malt backbone betwixt the intense hop throwdown. Carbonation is rather steady, with a finish that leans dry and chalky with a bit of extra hop pellet goodness. However, it borders on astringent and definitely sips more like an IPA than a traditional, easier-drinking APA, but I'll give it a pass because it's just so damn good. If I can get this fresh and often, I absolutely will. So good to finally be able to have a beer I've only been able to read about for years!\n",

      "Drank from a 16 oz/1 pint can purchased at Yankee Spirits, Sturbridge, MA Served in a tulip Hazy, yellow ochre appearance. The body was topped by a frothy, finger-tall, off-white crown that quickly fell to swirling wisps and a small halo. Some streaky arcs of lacing trickled down the glass. The aroma was really hoppy and pure. A dank, weedy quality was quite apparent initially but subsided within a few minutes. Juicy citrus notes took over. Orange and tangerine came through strongest. There was a subtle sweetness as well. A touch malty and honey-ish. Tropical fruits were also detectable. Mango and papaya perhaps. The tropical fruit notes intensified as the beer warmed. The flavor profile was also very citrus forward but definitely not as complex as the nose. Juicy orange and tangerine notes dominated. Bit of honey-like sweetness in the center. More orange and orange peel on the back end and in the finish. Just a hint of rind-like bitterness. Notes of candied orange peel lingered after the swallow. The mouthfeel was frothy and fluffy. Medium bodied for the style. The liquid contained a fine, fairly zippy, tongue blanketing effervescence. PseudoSue is a terrific, citra hopped American pale ale. That said, I am not quite sure it impresses most people these days in the way that it once did.

      "Sought this out after seeing how highly rated it was. Didn't really read the reviews, probably should have. Looks great, lively carbonation, slight hop haze, fluffy and persistent white head. It's basically a model for what a pale ale or lighter IPA should look like. The nose is bursting with juicy citra notes. It's got mango and tropical fruit with a hint of what reminds me of raspberries. Hard to even pick up much malt, and a whiff of alcohol sweetness. Some sweet dankness is in there too. Taste follows suit with a big ol smack of mangos, some dankness. Lively tropical fruits dominate with hardly any malt presence at all. Bitterness is noticeable, but restrained. Probably a little more bitterness than one would expect from most Pale Ales. Reminds me at times of Alpine Duet or Sculpin back when Ballast point was small. It's good, quite good, but it's an IPA. Look man, I get it, hops are the shit, IPA's rule, turn the flavor up to 11. But when I reach for a pale ale, I'm not looking for hop bombs. This beer is very unbalanced to me. I like some malt presence in my pale ales. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is still far and away the reigning champ in pale ale world for me. Maybe I've just stopped enjoying hops as much as I've been over saturated with that flavor. Idk. I get why people like this beer, but I would rate it more highly if it were called an IPA. That's just me. Also, alcohol is fairly noticeable for the abv. Bottom line if you want a lighter, lower IBU IPA, that kicks you in the mouth with juicy citra mango and tropical fruit flavors, then this is your jam!\n",

It's a powerful aroma that you get immediately upon popping the can open. Taste follows the nose with the fresh fruits and pine. There is some sweetness up front letting you know that the malt is there under all the hop flavor, but the hops definitely control this APA. There's a nice bitterness there too that reminds me of \"old school\" APA's. A hoppy aftertaste remains behind. The feel is rather soft, pleasant, and approachable. The carbonation is light but noticeable. It also finishes pretty dry. Overall, this is a really nice pale ale. At 5.2% ABV it's also very drinkable.

Mild floral and citrus. Lots of bread, crackers and malts. It doesn't smell bad, it just doesn't really have much going on at all. The flavors are clean, crisp and refreshing. More floral notes along with some hints of grapefruit. Lots of fresh grass. More fresh bread and crackers. Moderate to low bitterness. Not much hop flavors going on. Malts do their thing. Alcohol goes unnoticed. Mouthfeel is nice. It's medium-bodied with moderate to active carbonation. It's very fluffy, smooth and easy to drink. This is a solid pale ale. It's a good classic and traditional example of the style, but it's definitely not \"chock-full of dank, aromatic hops\".

Good and solid aroma. Very impressive palate. Light bodied, but with a sense of creamy texture and feel, giving to a nice malt sweetness. Hop angle is actually more citrus orange tasting, mixing with touches of earth and a little bit of mint, particularly on the finish. Excellent peppy mouthwash like flavor, but with a good sweetness.

Very light nose of mixed citrus with a touch of spice. With a name of 420, one would expect a dank nose. This one is not. Light body that has a smooth element. Good carbonation for the body with just enough mid effervescence and a prickly finish. The flavor profile is average - not bad, but not quite solid either. Intensity, complexity and balance are adequate resulting in a tasty pale ale but nothing really pops. It begins with a blended hop flavor that has subtle citrus notes then flows to a very mildly bittered middle. A hint of sweetness arrives to balance an equally weak bitterness.

Head formation is two fingers in height and rather eager to form. Retention is good. Aroma is pine, citrus and dank hops layered over and between earthy, nutty, bready malts. Balance is delightful, forming a clean break between hops and malts. Even hops contradict and balance each other out between the light bite of the pine to the soft sweetness of the citrus. Flavor profile puts malts on equal footing as the hops, with malts hitting notes of earthy, nutty, toasty, and bready. Hops carry forward the aroma, hitting notes of pine, orange, and light dank and resin. Dank and resin hop notes linger the longest on the tongue, with the malts and other hops ceasing in random order prior. It's balanced, without letting the drinker forget the delight of hops. A medium-thick consistency carries a fuzzy, filling mouth feel that adds to the already well-nuanced notes. Overall, balance is supreme, and this showcases balance well, while still allowing the malts and hops their own solos and excursions.  Served in a 12oz snifter from a 500mL bottle.\n",

      "Bottled on 9/4/18 Pours a mostly clear golden orange with a thick two and a half finger white head, a foamy, almost cloud-like visual; excellent head retention at its peak, and still holds relentlessly at the one finger mark; plenty of sticky, soapy lacing clings on. Aromas of piney hops against a delicate malt backbone to start, followed by notes of fresh cut grass, wilted mint, and garden herbs to go along with dank peach, citrusy grapefruit pith, tangerine, and orange peel; the hops notes are both edgy and refined, adding the necessary balance to what is a compact, subtly evocative, and classic pale ale bouquet. Taste is simultaneously hoppy, bitter, and malty, and the balance is really something excellent; the notes of fresh grass build to a showcase of lightly bitter hops merging on the profile with smooth, clean malt in a truly symbiotic manner; it is a simple but pure display of what these two elements can accomplish. Mouthfeel is well-carbed, something that builds on the beer’s smooth medium body; ultimately, it results in a creamy-smooth feel with a good bit of heft on the palate and a nice hop prickle on the finish; it certainly (and maybe somewhat unexpectedly) holds its own, while never losing a comfortable crispness. Such a simple beer on the outset, and one that maybe took awhile to grab my attention considering the flavor bombs it exists alongside today (as well as the format and slightly off-putting pricing), but a beer this well-done can’t be ignored. A classic take on the style that has a bit of everything; simple but with quiet complexities, MO stands out for its ultimate drinkability and total polish as a pale ale.\n",

      "Split with Goblinmunkey7 , growler filled about 4 hours ago A: Burnt orange to medium amber with some honey and golden highlights - pours with a big, white head, keeps a wispy cap, leaves some nice streaks of lacing  S: Excellently balanced citrus, pine, and pale malts - not particularly intense, but intensely balanced - fresh, ripe orange, tangerine, and grapefruit - fleshy and floral citrus - pine needles with a hint or resin and dank notes - clean, pale malts with a touch of caramel T: Balanced, clean, stupidly drinkable - nice level of citrus, with some orange, tangerine, and ruby red grapefruit flavors - very floral - pine, with some resin, some hints of mint - pale malts, with a touch of caramel - grainy bread - medium level of bitterness- extremely clean and drinkable M: On the light side of medium, nicely carbonated, smooth, finishes somewhat dry O: Superior to Robert Pattinson Hill Farmstead makes absurdly clean beers. That being said, this is one of the cleanest, which really shines in an American Pale Ale. Worth the drive.\n",

Taste is out of this world. Fruity, with notes of mango, citrus and even some strawberry. Piney, bitter, and dank as well! And so drinkable, it's scary. Try this stuff. ASAP!\n",

S: Very dank for such a light beer. Orange, grapefruit, and lemon - emphasis on the grapefruit, though. I like it. T: Follows the nose. Very juicy beer - probably more of an IPA than an APA. Tons of grapefruit, followed by smatterings of lemon and orange. Good. F: Crisp, like all NG beers. Great. O: I liked it a lot. Probably not worth the trip up to NG with all the great IPAs and APAs in Chicago, but it's still a fine brew.\n",

Drinks VERY easy for 7%, I would have clocked it closer to 5-something% It's a satisfying fresh hop beer, good enough where I'm considering picking up another 6-pack.

      "12 oz. Bottle Pours out with a mostly clear and sparkly golden color. Certainly unfiltered, but not hazy. A white foam over forms and dissipates pretty quick to just a white ring around the perimeter. The fresh hops give off an incredible aroma. Thick and dense layers of sweet fruits, fresh pine tree, dried grasses, wet and dank earth, and a musky, green hop complexity that certainly lives up to the \"fresh hop\" standard. Honestly, this is one of the finest, and pungent noses I've had the pleasure of smelling.  First sip....ZANG!! POW! BROom! Hop attack to the face!  The layers of the hoppy complexity is deep. Tastes like freshly crushed up hop cones straight of the vine. Major earthiness, dried grasses and leaves, herbs and pepper bite, zippy citrus, pine sap, and subtle layers of tangy fruits. The hop taste changed and mutates with every sip. A green-leafy taste lingers on. The malt is medium bodied, crisp and grainy with field grains and golden earthy tones. A sharp, light and crispy bite at first and becomes a bit more hefty on the way down.  This is easily one of the very best APA's I've had. Period.\n",

Satisfying amounts of lacing clings to the glass as I glug.  S: Full on citrus with slight dank resin and fresh cut grass. I get a little black pepper as well, but citrus is the star of the show. T: A perfect mixture of grassy hops and fresh citrus. Grapefruit and lemon are dominant fruit flavors. The hop profile is earthy and grassy. Lingering sweet malt flavor and lemon in the aftertaste.  F: Rather full bodied. Carbonation is spot-on.  O: It's delicious. First time trying this, and I will anticipate its release next year. I am very glad to have tried. Cheers!\n",

      "Pours a crystal clear brass hue, with a winger of sudsy off-white head. Beautiful streams of effervescence streaming up from the bottom, keeping that head alive. Nose is wonderfully big, bright, vibrant fresh hops. Oddly enough, reminds me of lupulin. Green and fresh with that creamy, almost coconut vibe. Smells a touch like Lawson's. Definitely some signature Lagunitas grapefruit action, but also some sweetness and earthy dankness from mosaic. Palate - That's a yummy one. I've been drinking Tree House exclusively for the last week, so big change of pace here, but can definitely appreciate it. It opens up bright and crisp, and then a slightly unpleasing metallic note chimes in, but then a big dankness takes over, getting danker and danker, until the bright citrus tines it opened up with are but a mere memory. There's some light biscuit malt in the very back end, but the hops are the star here. I get some mosaic in the very beginning, with some melon and berry, but it gets really earthy really fast, and it actually finishes kind of savory. The more I drink it, the more I'm questioning whether or not I like it. Definitely unique.  Mouthfeel is light/medium light, and very crisp. A lively carbonation keeps it very airy and snappy. Overall, a decent beer? Sure. One I can finish? Yes. One I would seek out again? No. And I certainly do no understand the hype surrounding this one. Ah, wait, maybe I do, for West Coast standards, this is killer. Among the world-class New England beers? Well...let's spare ourselves the argument. Cheers!\n",

Got this at Trader Joe's drinking in Redding, Nov 13th, 2018. Really well done, a little light tasting for expectations, but I suppose this is a part of people's opinion in rating it so high.\n",

Lighy smoothness through the middle followed by pleasant warmtg to the end. Medium high grapefruit and orange flavors from beginning to end. Hop flavors are fresh and dank. Medium spicy hop bitterness through the middle followed tropical flavors toward the end with a nice malty undertone. Finished relatively cleanly for an ale with light spicy hop notes.

Slight messy sticky lace wrapped around near the top of the glass. The aroma had a fantastic blend of orange pith to pine to bitter oily dankiness flowing on into some rolled sweet grass with a touch of lemon peel on the back end. The flavor was a fabulous gripping fully bittersweetness of the blend of the orange pith to the citrus and grassy sweet bitter hop oils. Mild aftertaste of the orange pith, light pine and some danky sweet onion. The mouthfeel was almost medium bodied, seemed to sit just a touch under with a good sturdy carbonation about it. ABV felt good. Mild stickiness in the finish with a touch of bittersweet orange and grapefruit. Overall, just when I thought I was going to walk away from drinking Lagunitas, takes one of their \"OneHitter Series\" beers and makes it into a homerun.

      "6-pack purchased at Binnys Lincoln Park in Chicago today. Bottled yesterday (10/16/17) so quite literally, this beer was Born Yesterday. Open the bottle and the aroma pops right out. Pours a hazy yellow-orange, head is consisted of larger bubbles than I'm used to for Lagunitas. The head fades somewhat quickly, probably due to the irresponsible amount of hop oils in this beer. Not complaining here. Primary aroma is HUGE orange, with some tropical (mostly mango and some pineapple) and dank as well. Flavor is not quite as huge as the aroma, but still very nice. Lots of citrus, orange and grapefruit pith bitterness. It's \"juicy\", but also has nice bitterness to tell you it's beer. I really like it, especially for an $11 6-pack.

A: Very hazy to turbid, but bright gold. A thin band of white foam serves as a head, over fairly low visible carbonation. S: Nice here for sure. Tropical, citrus, juicy melon, dank. Notes of stone fruit and grassiness as well. Malt aroma is nearly absent - only very light cracker sweetness from the two-row malts. T: Follows the nose. Juicy tropical fruits, dank, and tangelos. Grapefruit rind, melons, and pineapple. Light cracker malts again. More tropical fruit juiciness and bitterness in the hang. M: A heavier body than a lot of APAs, but far from thick. Low alcohol presence and good carbonation sensation. O: A really, really enjoyable beer. And it was just as good, if not better, from the bottle.

A foamy snow white head gathers over top and makes a mess of my glass on the drink down. The nose is bursting with a litany of hop aromas. Mandarin orange with grapefruit, tropical flower, sweet pine, and hempy herbs stand out. I get some sweet bready malt action underneath the waves of fresh hops with a slight of caramel likeness to it. Flavor doesn’t let up as well. Uber fresh hop botanicals. Citrus zest of orange, lemon, and grapefruit meet some wild tropical and a hit of dank pine. Light sweet pale malt support there with some mildly noticeable alcohol and a few fruity esters.

Medium bodied with a light creaminess and peppery carbonation. Almost underwhelming at first, the finish reveals a complex hop bill with very pleasant lightly citrus and floral flavors.

T - The spiky hop, horsey with oregano and basil, to a biscuit malt, and a sharp bitter close, verging on medicinal. M - Brisk and drying. A robust feel for a beer that barely cracks 5% ABV.

Retains a thick ring of white around the edges and a large island of foam and a couple of bubbles in the middle. Leaves a few trails of lacing on the glass. S (4): Smells like cascade hops! And a good dollop of malt. Kind of a sweet orange marmalade thing going on. There is a distinct cascade smell of orangey dankness. I really enjoy the smell of this beer. T (3.5): Dry, balanced arrival. Mid palate fills your mouth with light, bready malt and cascade hops. Malt with a good bit of piney dankness at the end. Website says it has some Northern Brewer, Simcoe, and Citra. The Northern Brewer would explain that dankness at the end. And I can definitely get some citra on the finish. M (3.5): Solidly midweight, but very active carbonation on the tongue makes it seem much lighter. This is really carbonated and tingly. A little slickness on the end that stops it from being a really clean finish.  O (3.75): If you were to ask me what does an American Pale Ale taste like? This would be the answer. Really a great go-to American pale. Perfectly balanced between malt and hops. Good for just when you want a beer and want it to be good. A little less malty or sweet than either Mirror Pond or Burning River, but very similar to both. Less hoppy overall, but more dank, and with fewer esters than Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.\n",

Mouthfeel: It's crisp and refreshing but with a heftier than average medium body and medium-high carbonation. Overall: It looks good and tastes good too, but the scent a is just on another level.

      "Pale near clear golden pour - 1 finger short lived head. Smell is pungent pine, grapefruit, a bit of dank sweatiness. Taste starts with a touch of grainy malt sweetness, quickly giving way to bitter grapefruit peel, piney hoppiness. The bitterness lingers on the palate through a medium light body into a dry finish. Delicious.\n",

      "12oz bottle - so, my whirlwind tour this week of Founders offerings (from afar) ends here. This beer pours a slightly hazy, pale golden yellow colour, with four fingers of puffy, loosely foamy, and bubbly dirty white head, which leaves some decent splatter pattern lace around the glass as it slowly dissipates. It smells of dank pine resin, bready and crackery cereal malt, a bit of uric acid, faint orange and red grapefruit citrus rind, and more leafy, weedy, and musky floral green hops. The taste is grainy and bready caramel malt, muddled domestic citrus peel, a further indistinct tropical fruitiness, some damp minerality, and more leafy, herbal, and piney verdant hoppiness. The carbonation is quite restrained in its somnolent frothiness, the body a so-so medium weight, and generally smooth, with nothing really causing a stir at this particular juncture. It finishes off-dry, the malt and mixed frooty esters predominating. Overall - this is a pleasant enough display of what the Mosaic hop varietal can do for you. Nice and complex, yet perfectly drinkable and enjoyable. Could definitely see crushing a number of these in a social (or hell, even anti-social) situation, should one suddenly arise.\n",

      "Golden and slightly hazy, but most notably a ton of sediment floating within. Moderate carbonation, and three fingers of off white head. Smells of pine and citrus, oranges and blueberries. Lemon and pepper, with hints of children's aspirin. Citrus orange, big dankness, biscuit and blueberries, and unripe strawberries. A deep and tongue coating bitterness. Light and crisp body, with a resinous, slightly sticky feel. Moderate to low carbonation. Got at LCBO, drinking in Muskoka, Dec 6th, 2017. Excellent APA.\n",

      "Reviewed from notes. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Cigar City snifter glass. A: Slightly hazy light gold. About ½” of foamy white head with decent retention on top of a good amount of visible carbonation. S: Light citrus, lemons and tangerines, and grassy hops with a touch of dankness. Light cracker malts. Not a huge aroma but appealing in a clean and hop-dominated way. T: Dank, tropical fruits, citrus rind and melon hops. Light cracker malts mostly stay out of the way. A touch of grapefruit flesh on the back end, and it finishes with more melon and dankness with moderate bitterness. M: The body is a touch on the light side for style. A good amount of fine carbonation, and the alcohol is well-hidden. O: Enjoyable, and a solid shelf offering for sure. I get no evidence of the barley in the malt bill that's claimed on the label. Maybe nothing I'd go on a hunt for, but I'll gladly drink the others in the fridge.\n",

Decent but not my favorite IPA from Founders.\n",

      "Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium golden amber with a one finger white head with great retention and lacing. Piney hops were evident as the cap came of the bottle. Aroma in the glass is pale malt, citrus and piney hops with light dankness, orange citrus and a little guava. Flavor is pale malt, dank citrus hops with a little pine, orange, lemon, hints of exotic fruit. Finishes with citrus hops, grapefruit and orange peel and some resinous pine. Medium bodied with light creaminess and nice mouth feel. A good showcase for the Mosaic hops, which show their nominal mixture of citrus, pine and fruit. The aromatic burst from the bottle was great, but more piney than the sitting hop aroma. Nevertheless, a fine herbal IPA with a fairly neutral tasting malt that still supports the hops very well. Good from start to finish with pleasant lingering citrus rind and pine.\n",

      "Hazy gold-orange brew that holds a creamy white head. An inch of that stuff. Visible, streaming carbonation replenishing it. Solid retention. Good, sticky lacing. Man is Mosaic fun! We got papaya, herbs, and digging deeper, a little berry. Malt aroma is subtle and simple, but a nice backdrop. Slight grassiness pops up, and as we keep drinking, that other fruit becomes easily identifiable as blueberry. Delicious, fresh blueberry comes even with the tropical fruit. Slight dank as well. Lot going on here, quite a treat! Bright tropical fruit, mainly papaya, is the first impression. Herbs and that nice, subtle grainy malt props up like a stage the titillating tastes of that yummy blueberry and even a little bit of citrus. Medium + bitterness that increases on the tongue with the finish. Said finish and aftertaste are fruit, bit of dank, and a slight minerally character. Malt can take on a more bready impression as beer warms. Quite a show. Medium-light body with a nice, cutting zip from carbonation in the middle of the palate.\n",

On the nose, tons of caramel, typical dankness from the moisac but very faint. Some fruitiness, mostly ripe clementines (mostly sweet, not that citrusy). Taste follows, with very little bitterness on the back. Very nice mouthfeel; not as chewy as the newer east coast pale ales, but still very comparable.

      "It is a slightly cloudy, bright gold with a whispy white dish soap head. The retention is average at best, but it maintains a fine ring.  Smells very good. It has that dank/earthy almost body odor like stank with some tropical citrus and stone fruit with very light crisp grains.  The flavor just doesn't pop as much as the aroma for me. There is an herbal/piney green, some lemon, grapefruit, and stone fruit/papaya, but not real dank and no mango like I normally get from mosaic hops. The bitterness is solid and lingers with some resin. The pale malts are very light, and are much more noticeable in the aroma.  Light and crisp body. A little too hoppy and rough on the palate for a pale ale.  Pretty solid beer overall, yet a bit disappointing given the ingredients and the brewer.\n",

      "Traded for this a while ago, as the date on the bottom of the can read 1/24/17 with \"HOW ABOUT NO\" written below that. It's easy to see how this would be Trillium's flagship offering as this was quite heavy, dank, and tasty at the same time, while being a good example of what an American Pale Ale should be. Even though this can was two years old, it aged well and had very little sediment in it, as the flavors held up quite well over time! This had a nice pour to it as the liquid was a quietly radiant apricot with a fair head topping it off. A thin ring of lacing was left around the top of my pint glass as the faint collar was the best residue that I could find. A few soapy sections remained as I worked my way through this but it was disappointing for something that was quite enjoyable. Lots of bright stone fruit, peach, wheat, and white grape could be found in the varied nose as the taste had quite a range of flavors to it as well. Light wood, citrus pith, and a subtle earthiness could be found on the palate as this warmed up as I enjoyed the nuances of this beer. Moderately slick and lightly carbonated, this felt like Hawaiian Punch in the aftertaste as the tropical and juicy notes lingered on my tongue once the liquid fully went down... Not a lot of booze to this as this truly was an American Pale Ale and not an IPA that went by another name. Balanced in body, there was little sediment in the liquid or at the bottom of my pint glass once I finished this off. Certainly enjoyable, this wasn't a standout beer but had enough going for it that the hype wasn't entirely unjustified. Fans of Trillium would be wise to see this out although it's certainly not a hop bomb or full of dankness. Instead, this was a beer that anyone could easily embrace, since there was enough to like about it from the get-go!\n",

      "16oz can - Double Dry Hopped version Pours a small finger of white head into my willi becher glass, a little soapy looking, dissipates quickly. Good initial lacing. Body looks like orange juice. Meh, looks ok I guess. Nose is pretty juicy, loaded with grapefruit, some mango.  Dank, piney hops linger underneath the fruit. Small amount of creamy wheat present as well. Pretty nice job of staying balanced between traditional hop aromas, and fruit. Not an “American pale ale” by any means, as their website says, regardless, smells pretty good. Flavor is good, but doesn’t quite have that crisp refreshing punch I’m looking for. A little under carbonated, and while the hops are there, they don’t help make up for the lack of carbonation with any real mouthfeel contributions – drinks like juice. As for actual flavors, mostly those dank piney hops come through. Grapefruit is a secondary flavor, mango is not really present. I’m glad the hearty hop notes are the ones that are shining, yet it is still missing something - perhaps a little watery in some areas. At times, it’s hard to differentiate between poor mouthfeel, and flavor. Definitely not a sweet NE style, which again, is good. Tastes good, but has its issues. Not much else to say about mouthfeel that hasn’t already been said, under carbonated, a little watery, bitterness does not linger, not too sweet. Overall sub par. The drinkability is very high, it’s not a perfect beer, but it’s very tasty and unoffensive. Appearance turned out decent I guess. Lacing was patchy to say the least, but better than nothing. Overall it’s a tasty brew that hits home with the right flavors, but it is a little derailed by a low carbonation and watery taste/feel.\n",

      "Pours a hazy peach coloration with a small, fizzy head. Smell is initially quite lovely, with hoppy, juicy tropical/citrus fruit notes of mango and passion fruit with a hint of pineapple and tangerine, but takes on a light cat piss note as it sits. Taste is very bright and hoppy, dominated sweet, juicy tropical fruit notes of mango, passion fruit and pineapple and with zesty citrus notes of grapefruit and tangerine. There's a light dankness and a hint of pine to this as well, almost no malt presence detectable though. Finishes with a light bitterness and very mild hop burn. Soft mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation. This is the quintessential NE style Pale Ale and I would say that it has an amazing juicy hoppiness, mouthfeel and depth of flavour for a Pale Ale, BUT is this even a Pale Ale at 6.6% ABV? Nonetheless, it's still an excellent beer at a relatively low ABV. The balance of sweet tropical fruit, zesty citrus fruit and dankness/pine really is outstanding here.\n",

      "Dated 5/9/18 on the bottom of the can, 12 days since brewing. Pours a nearly opaque straw-gold with a finger and a half of compact white head. Aromas bursting out of the can as soon as I cracked it open. First notes of the nose are of spices; pepper, coriander and cumin. This is followed by ruby grapefruit pith, black licorice, honeydew and a selection of over-ripened tropicals (mango, apricot, pineapple). Taste follows the nose with the over-ripened fruit and spices, but also brings in some dankness, pine resin and pale grainy malt. Body is a smooth medium- with low dryness and a medium- hoppy bitterness.

Hop aromas spill into the air; citrus, orange, tropical pineapple. Slightly dank with some alcohol soaked wheat and malt.  Mango and pineapple with a peach finish. The flavor is hop driven, the dry biscuit malt takes a back seat.  The light crisp body is good, and the hop flavor and gentle hop bite are good. I'm not getting enough \"pale ale\" malt body behind those hops.  I like it and I'll seek out some more of this brew but, honestly, it's an all-hop pale ale...to me.\n",

      "Thanks to HighLowJack for sending this one! Reviewed from (long-standing) notes. Poured from a 16 oz. can into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass. A: Turbid yellowish gold, typical of the New England IPA style. A thin fluffy white head forms, with low visible carbonation. S: Melon and citrus, dank and tropical. Lighter flowery, minty, and spicy hops. Biscuity malts and some wheat but without almost any grainy character. Nice, though I’m not blown away. T: Melon, tangerine, and citrus rind. Dankness swells up with pineapple and tropical fruit following. Biscuity malts don't add a ton of sweetness, but the bill seems hefty for an APA. It finishes with more dank and melon and orange juice, and stays only very modestly bitter in the hang. M: This is full-bodied for anything calling itself an APA; it's even leaving sheets on the sides of the glass. The carbonation is a touch on the low side, and there's minimal alcohol flavors. O: This was awfully tasty. I'm not sure that it lived up to its sizeable hype or not. But I can certainly see where the hype came from. Very, very good.\n",

A fantastic tangy aroma smacks you as the glass is raised with a base of earthy dank citrus and pine. For me the fruit notes (peach and mango maybe?) were very subtle but present. The taste is smooth and creamy and a little bread-sweet, which augments the dank hops. The tropical fruits come out in the taste with hints of orange and pineapple along with the citrus and grassy pine. Low bitterness lingers in the aftertaste along with the tangy side of the hop flavor. Mouth feel is light and creamy with minimal stickiness and a zing of carbonation. It becomes more juicy the longer it sits. Just wow! As a fan of the style this is a huge treat of balanced dank and sweetness. I am drinking this only 4 days after being canned so I suspect that it is more earthy than others have noted. You may want to let this sit a bit before opening.\n",

O - Strikes a nice balance between a Pale Ale and a Northeast IPA. Reminds me somewhat of a Three Floyds Zombie Dust although this is even more hop-centric.

      "12oz bottle, a single from the local Whole Foods in suburban Denver. This beer pours a slightly hazy medium copper amber hue, with two fingers of loosely foamy, and mostly bubbly dirty white head, which leaves some attractive spackled random polygon lace around the glass as things bleed off. It smells of somewhat dank floral hops, clammy, slightly toasted bready and biscuity caramel malt, and some further stale grassy, weedy essences. The taste is more or less a continuation of the same - cludgy, clammy pale biscuity and caramel malt, underwhelming floral and citrus notes, and a withering earthy mustiness. The carbonation is mildly astringent, a guise that it keeps up with a persistent glee - the body medium-light in weight, and so-so smooth, that ingrained pithiness not content to give it up just yet. It finishes off-dry, the touched bready malt ceded a sort of free rein in the absence of any hops that seem to still give a shit. I was led to believe a whole lot more about the greatness of this offering than actually came to pass once I encountered it - there is nothing crisp, nor overly hoppy about it - blandness is the best word I have to proffer, which makes me sad by the same token - the marketing, and my introduction to it, perhaps built it up a bit too much.

      "Bottle poured into a Lagunitas mason jar A: Pours golden orange amber with a frothy off white head that settles to a firm layer and laces very nicely.

T: Dank herbal notes, citrus, grapefruit, orange, and lemon, pine, just a hint of tropical fruit, papaya, mango, and pineapple, biscuity malt, and caramel sweetness.

S: Orange and grapefruit zest, citrus oils just ripping into your nostrils, like freshly shredded orange peels. Intensely zesty and zippy. Smells dank and grassy...not unlike marijuana, as well. A bit of biscuity malt backbone and typical Lagunitas chemical/rubber, but mostly huge ripping citrus and weed. T: Follows the nose exactly. Enormous fresh oranges and grapefruit. The sharpest and most acidic aspects of the fruits. Like all the oils of the skin condensed into a juice. Extremely zesty, sharp, orange and grapefruit. Some sweetness, like the juice of a ripe pink grapefruit. A bit of biscuit malt backbone, earthy, with characteristic rubber/dankness, and a nice weed-like presence. Super citrusy, though. Crisp and dry on the backend, with a bit of lingering citrus peel bitterness. F: Medium-light bodied, light enough to be refreshing and crushable, but heavy enough to please the palate. Moderate to medium-high carbonation, smooth and boisterous on the tongue. Finishes crisp and dry. O: An incredible pale ale. This bottle is super fresh and it's delicious. It's super hoppy but hits the marks in every conceivable way. Simply a pleasure to drink. Amazing!\n",

      "Almost perfectly clear yellow-orange body, soapy white head, intricate webs of lace stick to the glass. Nose gives off lemon, herbs, butter, orange peel, melon, light malt nearly like wheat and pilsner. The flavor is predominantly bitter, also offering herbal, citric, slightly malty, and dank flavors. The body is light and finely, abundantly carbonated, dry. I s'pose this is a good Pale Ale; favoring hoppy flavors but not to the extent of an IPA, kinda mild, balanced. It was all those, and even offered a great variety of hoppy flavors, and yet it failed to tickle my sweet spot. Perhaps it would be great on a hot day, but as it was the mild manner of each flavor didn't capture my attention.\n",

      "Pours a clear golden with a moderate frothy white head and a lace that retains throughout. The nose hits you with all kinds of hops aromas; an orange twang provides sweetness, grapefruit pith, dank and resiny hops. The sweetness from the aroma does not really carry over to the taste. This one is hops forward with a high side of medium bitterness. Piny, resiny and herbal. There is some citrusy sweetness in the finish, but it is mostly leafy, dry and the aftertaste is bitter.  The feel is smooth, medium bodied and on the high side for a pale ale, and the moderate carbonation provides a piercing tingle. For me this one blurs the line between APA and IPA. Regardless of its classification, it's pretty good.\n",

Once receded there is a full thick veil of lacing and a surprisingly thick collar... This one is 110% translucent... The color is a medium gold with vibrant orange undertones... A moderate bit of varying paced carbonation rises randomly throughout... A good bit of lacing clings to the sides of the glass as the session proceeds... The aroma is earthy and slightly dank... It's a strong all malt aroma dominated by bread crust and graham crackers... Perhaps some very faint hints of toffee and orange zest as well... The aroma was a good indicator of flavor... In addition to the strong malt base that was expected there is also a distinctive hoppiness and a slight metallic presence... On the fuller side of medium bodied... Dense and sits heavy on the tongue... Moderate carbonation... This one is a text book American Pale Ale...

      "Bright bronze with steady pocked snow white head that trails. 4 Herbal, floral, orange zest nose - fresh! 4 Thread of apricot-filled filo pastry with icing sugar, then grapefruit, white pine, pineapple (natch), and lemon balm hops. 4.25 Pith finish and numbing pine linger. Just past light, crisp, touch of oil, creamy. 4 Paler that expected and there's a sugared grapefruit thing on the nose that's tantalizing. That sugar carries over to be just the lightest malt load possible before all the light sides of C hops (no orange, pine resin, or dank) kick in. For all the sunshine here, there is a whack of chalky bitterness that hits a little harder than 47 IBUs. Not sure what to make of this vs the IPA, which is roughly the same ABV and IBUs. Hop Stoopid Lite, some people have said; I could get down with that. It's also soft and way drinkable - the only way, in fact, that it actually resembles an APA.

      "Got in a trade with The-Adjunct Hippie. 12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/7/2017. Pours fairly hazy/cloudy golden orange/amber color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with amazing retention, that reduces to a large cap that lasts the whole glass. Thick soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, apricot, mango, melon, lemon zest, orange peel, light pepper, pine, honey, caramel, toasted bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/pine hops and moderate dark/bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, apricot, mango, melon, lemon zest, orange peel, light pepper, pine, honey, caramel, toasted bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate pine, citrus peel, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, apricot, mango, melon, lemon/orange peel, citrus rind, pepper, pine, honey, caramel, toasted bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/pine hops and moderate dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Light-moderate increasing dryness from bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy/sticky, and lightly resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 6%. Overall this is an awesome American pale ale. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/pine hops and moderate dark/bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the modestly bitter/drying finish. Never overly aggressive. Really great mix of juicy, dank, and vibrancy on hops; with a nice balancing malty backbone. A really enjoyable offering, and spot on style example.\n",

      "$ 14.16 (Including tax)/six pack of 12 oz bottles ($ 0.197/oz) at Chalet Party Shoppe, Midbury, IN. Bottled 9-6-17. Stored in cooler at shop, then in my 42 degree reefer. Served at 42 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter.  Aroma – Pine. The initial coniferous aroma fades and is replaced by a slightly dank odor as the beer warms. Head – Large (Maximum 6.2 cm, aggressive pour), off white low-density head, average retention, diminishing to a three mm ring with lacing from ring’s initial retraction and a heaped rocky partial layer. Lacing – Good. Wide band of tiny to medium bubbles. Body – Orange, cloudy.  Flavor – The pine from the nose is absent but a distinct dank oniony flavor is present. Allowing it to warm in my mouth only makes it warmer. No malt, no alcohol, no diacetyl.  Palate – Medium, watery, soft carbonation. Impression: A passable dank IPA. Certainly not my favorite 3F product. Appearance 4, Aroma 3.5, Flavor 3.5, Palate 4, Overall 3.5.\n",

      "Been ages since I had a beer from Three Floyds as they haven't distributed to New Jersey in years. This was one of two of their offerings that I traded for a recently over at Other Half and it certainly didn't disappoint, although there wasn't anything particularly memorable about it...except for that crazy-ass label! Not a bad pour to this as the beer poured a nice golden hue with plenty of head and a good amount of lacing left behind once I started to work my way through it. The rings were thick and stiff as the foam never quite settled down on top of the liquid. Soapy with lemon and herbal notes, the aroma wasn't strong but certainly had a unique profile. Grass, dank vegetables, and floral notes followed up in the taste but this seemed so mellow that it came across as a light take on an English Pale Ale. A nice resin slickness was left behind as a metallic, tangerine aftertaste softly came in and faded away before the next sip. Not strong or weak, this was nicely balanced with a light body and bitterness that kept this pretty unassuming. Not a bad beer but there could have been more going on here, so that the liquid would be more in alignment with the gesture on the bottle!\n",

      "The pour easily yields two plus fingers of agitated eggshell white foam, the surface is punctuated by islands of larger bubbles, retention is strong and the lacing broad and sticks for some time. The liquid is a hazy amber orange, more translucent than near to opaque, a few super-miniscule bubbles are visible. The nose has a concentrated, if not reduced, feel to it, dank herbal funk, corn syrup, caramel, butterscotch, tangerines, tar resin, peppercorns, maybe some light breadiness by way of pastry or scone, not getting any specific, distinct fruit scents, overall it has a steamrolling effect in the nostrils and has presence after the scents have mostly vacated. In the mouth it’s full-bodied, carrying more of that monolithic approach, the carbonation is arguably weak, adds more smooth creaminess than anything else. Most prevalent factor remains the wet forest floor like leafy qualities, tar, earth and pine sap, just tastes vegetal. More mixed citrus here and slightly more delineated white pit fruit. Floral with more of a tea leaf than potpourri character. The butterscotch drops back a notch. A little too “big” for casual pounding but could anyone really expect that here?\n",

      "Pours a slightly cloudy, dark golden orange color with apricot edges and a half finger white head that immediately fades into a thin, lasting ring. Sporadic spotty lacing left behind. Dank floral hop aroma with sticky resins and fresh cut grass countered by tropical/citrus fruit sweetness and a pale malt backbone. Pine needle and kind buds followed by grapefruit, lemon peel, caramel and biscuit. Full body and extremely hop forward for the style. There's a blast of dank, sticky bitterness that lingers over the sweeter notes and malt backbone into a bone dry finish. Very dry and bitter but not overwhelmingly so. Dank resins, grassy pine and spruce tip dominate. Subtle grapefruit sweetness along with citrus peel, caramel, bread and biscuit. Very intense and complex for a pale ale. Decent balance but could use a little more to counter the aggressive bitterness. Great hop flavors and enough of a malt presence to balance things out without interfering.\n",

      "Bottle received in a recent trade with spinaltapped, thanks dude. This one pours a dark orange, slightly cloudy, with a long lived half inch head, and a lot of lacing. Smells pretty good here, some grapefruit, mango, candied pineapple, and some earthy aromas as well. This is a pretty unique tasting pale ale amongst similar fruit bombs. One of the strongest flavors is mango, but it's not the typical sweet mango you get, it's this kind of dank over-ripe mango that's interesting, along with some mild earthy onion, candied fruit, and marijuana. Luckily the onion character is supporting, rather than starring here, and doesn't get distracting.  This is medium bodied, with a crisp and juicy mouthfeel, and a moderate level of carbonation. A really nice pale ale here, not quite to the level of Zombie Dust, but sill a really nice job here from Three Floyds.\n",

      "Bomber into a snifter. Aggressive pour. Nice hazy gold/orange. Big, pillowy off-white head of foam. Smells awesome; sweet fruit, grapefruit, pineapple, strawberries, candied sugar, and peppermint. Honestly one of the best smelling beers I've had. Medium weight and rich, creamy mouthfeel. Tastes a bit similar to a couple of their other PA's, but still good. I get pine, citrus, and notes of grapefruit, orange, and berries. Dry finish with a bit of a dank, tart aftertaste. This is a good beer, but I feel like it's strangely similar to Yum Yum. Maybe it's the a certain type of hops the two share, or something. But I enjoyed Yum Yum, and I enjoyed this. This one had a bit of the same funky taste, which I didn't care for. Not sure what specific ingredient or brewing technique attributes to this, but if anyone knows what type of hops SSMF, Yum Yum, and Alpha King are made with, I'd be curious to know. While this is good, I'm not sure I could tell the difference between this and another 3F PA in a blind taste test.\n",

      "Trillium Galaxy Dry-Hopped Fort Point A: This Trillium skates dangerously close to the pond water opacity that is Tree House, staying just on this side of murky. It is full of particulate reminiscent of its forefather Heady Topper. These particles are tossed about by the rather active carbonation, which also contributes to an impressive retention and a settling into thick, dense crust of the once two-finger cream-colored head. Lacing is also very good. As with most of these DDH beers, some will find the yeast and hop matter off-putting, but it is an otherwise brilliant example of the NE IPA substyle. 4.75/5 A: Strong peach and apricot notes dominate a juicy cuvée of grapefruit and orange juice. A resinous dankness lurks underneath, as expected of the sometimes heavily bitter Galaxy hop. Interesting notes of papaya and passionfruit lie partially hidden underneath the earthy grass and pine. Finally, a crackery malt serves as the canvas for the entire beer. This seems exceedingly well-balanced and reined in, despite the sometimes overbearing Galaxy. 4.5/5 T: Unfortunately, Galaxy refused to be tamed in the taste. Bitter grass, resinous pine, earthy dankness, and bitter grapefruit pith dominate the tongue initially and hardly let up. It is possible to pick out some juicy peach, melon, and passion fruit underneath the rampaging Galaxy (especially in the aftertaste), but overall this is heavily dominated by earthy, almost spicy bitterness. Orange juice comes out more each sip, but bitter citrus rind also builds in much the same way. Lemon and lightly bitter floral notes are present in the aftertaste as well. The malt is very dry and crackery, lending only a slight kiss of sweetness that is all but drowned out by the hops. As with many DDH beers, this one is too hoppy for its own good, covering up some of the great complexity, but it is still very tasty. 4.25/5 M: Again, the hops are just too much here. The bitterness puts a toe into unpleasant territory becoming almost medicinally astringent and chalky. The beer is very dry, yet the feel is typically medium full and creamy, astonishingly so for a pale ale. Carbonation is prickly yet soft, right where it should be. The sharp bitterness on the end just proves too much for the rest of the beer, and paradoxically a stickiness is left on the lips. 4/5 O: I know that I am in the minority with finding the DDH iterations of these beers less palatable than their regular counterparts, but the hoppiness is just too much sometimes. The well-crafted balance of the \"normal\" versions displays all the complexity with better drinkability in a more enjoyable package. High end hop heads and west-coast fans will definitely prefer the DDH beers, but give me the good, old-fashioned juicy NE IPA any day. Pair with Cattle Decapitation's \"The Anthropocene Extinction,\" which was also grand in its own way at the expense of much of the nuance and personality that made \"Monolith of Inhumanity\" so compelling. 4/5\n",

Tastes like tropical fruity citrus, some mango, pineapple, big passionfruit notes, some guava, mild grain, with a light bitter dank pine finish. Feels medium bodied, creamy with low carbonation.

      "Appearance: Pours a slightly clear, light golden color with a mild white head that fades quickly. (3.5) Aroma: Strong aromas of tangerine, blood orange, grapefruit, and pineapple. Maybe some mango and dank tropic notes underneath. Can't get much of a malt profile with the stronger hops. (3.75) Flavor: Huge blood orange, grapefruit, and tangerine flavors. Light pineapple. A crystal malt sweetness in the middle, but it finishes relatively bitter with a pithy pineapple and citrus note. All fruit here. Flavors similar to an orange staburst, and orange soda, or an orange CapriSun. Crystal malt sweetness and pithy fruit finish. (3.75) Feel: Medium bodied. Well-carbonted. Crispy actually. A little grain, but not much. A pithy bitterness is left on the tongue. (3.5) Overall: Yes, this is a good beer. I can't really judge it as a pale ale, but rather an IPA. Tremendous flavor for a pale ale, but for a 7.5% IPA, I wouldn't say it's mind blowing. Also how can a pale ale have such high alcohol. I feel that adding alcohol for the sake of adding hop flavor or malt sweetness is shifty trick to add more flavor to the beer. I think breweries should focus on adding flavor without the easy addition of a higher ABV. Lagunitas repeatedly does this. While it's a great beer, I can't compare it to a traditional pale ale and it should be compared rather to an imperial IPA. In that sense, it's about what I would expect.

      "Poured from a single serve into a tulip Pours nearly clear--just a bit of haze--medium gold with a nice two-fingered foamy head. Fairly good lacing throughout.  Citrus aromas very forward--lemon, red grapefruit, white grapefruit. Clean pale malt sweetness is there too, with some piney and mineral notes.  The initial taste on the tip of the tongue is citrus--lemon mostly--with bready malt and some esters close behind. Piney and dank hops and mineral notes arrive at the middle of the quaff, with solid grassy, earthy, and floral notes at the finish. The nearly 8% ABV is barely noticeable, mostly as the brew warms. In fact, the brew almost \"phase shifts\" from APA at cool temperature to IPA at higher temp as the earthy floral hops open up at the warmer temperature. The feel of this brew is pretty special. Medium-light to medium bodied, it has excellent, but not overbearing carbonation. The finish isn't \"crisp\" but it arrives with a nice drying note. The booze is well-restrained. Like many, I'm guilty of paying insufficient attention to the APA style. This is a tasty take that pulls some IPA flavors into the discussion.\n",

      "Reviewed from (long-standing) notes. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into an El Catador teku glass. A: Mildly hazy but rich gold for style. A good amount of visible carbonation and a finger of white head fades relatively quickly. This looks pretty in the glass. S: Dank and citrus up front. Some tropical fruits, grapefruit, and lychee. Pale cracker malt body. Not huge but pretty decent for an APA. T: Dank and citrus up front again, with a solid backbone of tropical fruits, lychee, and melon hops. A light biscuity sweetness from the malts, but they mostly stay out of the way. It finishes with a fairly significant bitterness (especially for an APA), with more dank and grapefruit rind. M: A light body, and carbonation sensation is a touch on the low side. Low alcohol overall, but maybe a bit pronounced for style. O: I really enjoyed this one. It's nothing crazy or complex. But it’s clean with a nice hop profile, a malt bill without grainy flavors and a nice bitterness. I really dig this one. I wish it would be a canned in a six pack next time around.\n",

Price: $2.17 Purchased: April 22, 2016 Consumed: April 22, 2016 Misc.: Born on Feb. 15, 2016 at 12:11 a.m. PT; Reviewing this as an APA despite it being 7.9 pct. Not sure why it has taken so long to pull the trigger on this one, but I picked it up today. Looking forward to it because Lagunitas is one of my favorite breweries (top 5 with my overall rating) and I’m digging this one-hitter series. Don’t know much about this one in particular, but still expecting it to be good. Poured a golden, pale, clear color with 3-to-4 fingers of rocky, white head. Lots of bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Good amount of foamy layered lacing on the sides of the glass. Excellent retention. (Sight - 4.50) Smelled sharp, juicy citrusy notes from the beginning with tropical notes coming in late. Specifically got tangerine, blood orange, red grapefruit, nectarine, peach, lemon zest, lime, passion fruit, pineapple, caramel sweetness that is normal to Lagunitas beers and some danky pine. (Smell - 4.00) Taste arguably was better with first mouthful. Can’t believe how juicy this is, getting blood orange, nectarine, sweetened iced tea with lemon, red grapefruit, passion fruit, mango, pineapple, watered down pulpy orange juice, apricot (more than peach), stone fruit and some caramel sweetness. (Taste - 4.25) Light body. Oily texture. Average carbonation. Long, citrusy finish. (Feel - 4.00) This was a very nice American Pale Ale. I’m pretty sure if I would have reviewed this as an IPA, the ratings wouldn’t have been as good. Reminding me somewhat of a Maine Company beer. Would like to see a collab there.

      "12oz single bottle - now this is a hard one to pronounce, which I'm guessing is half the point. This beer pours a crystal clear, bright medium golden yellow colour, with two fingers of puffy, loosely foamy, and bubbly off-white head, which leaves a bit of sparse inkblot pattern lace around the glass as it evenly sinks away. It smells of pungent citrus esters (blood orange, lemon, red grapefruit, and lime), dank pine needles, a put-upon grainy caramel malt sweetness, some mild hard water flintiness, and more leafy, weedy, and grassy hop bitters. The taste is sharply citric fruit, once again - muddled mandarin orange and aged lemon most prominent - a bready and somewhat crackery caramel malt, fading pine resin notes, a still steadfast wet stoney thing, and further leafy, damp grassy, and sort of perfumed floral hoppiness. The bubbles are fairly laid-back in their gentle and sometimes coddling frothiness, the body a solid middleweight (perhaps punching above its weight class), and mostly smooth, even as all that fruity hop, um, goodness swirls about. It finishes off-dry, but only in the sense of citrus fruit inherencies that aren't quite up to their bittering alter egos. Yeah, this shit is dope, so much so that I actually regret procuring only the single bottle - even if hitting a whole sixer of this would put one in a world o' hurt (props to the essentially hidden near 8 points of wowee sauce!). Complex citrus, uninterested malt, and some 'healthy' greens, for your consideration.\n",

      "Cigar City Invasion A: In line with flagship Jai Alai, Invasion pours with very good clarity. It is slightly lighter in color, more of a golden orange than the brassier tones of the former, implying a lighter malt bill, most likely. Head does not get out of control, but it is a respectable two fingers, and it sticks around forever. Lacing is excellent, too. This is a great-looking pale ale. 4.75/5 A: Like its bigger brother, this succeeds at delivering on the tropical advertisement. Ruby grapefruit, mango, orange, tangerine, clementine, and a whiff of papaya make for a great fruit medley. Rindy and lightly dank bitterness balances out the candied fruit sweetness, which also has hints of caramel. Everything is a bit quiet, though, and nothing about this really stands out. Mosaic is really not obvious either, which is a problem since it is advertised on the can. There are no outright flaws here, though. 3.5/5 T: Mosaic comes through more in the flavor with some classic candied pineapple, papaya, and a little strawberry and blueberry, to the betterment of the beer. Many of the same fruits from the nose, especially grapefruit and clementine, follow through here. Spicy and floral bitterness cut the moderately juicy sweetness completely, leaving a nice biscuity, bready and mostly dry finish; this surprising malt complexity is the highlight This is a nicely flavorful pale ale for only 5%, and the malt sets this apart. 4.25/5 M: This is a delight to drink with a moderately full mouthfeel way beyond its lower ABV, perfectly medium-soft carbonation, and near-perfect level of bitterness and dryness, which leaves the barest trace of sweetness behind. This is perfect. 5/5 O: Though this stands in the shadow of Jai Also, the drier finish on Invasion actually appeals to me more. The nice maltiness is a great touch, and the overall balance is really wonderful. It is not treading in totally uncharted territory, but it is a really nice beer. Pair with the deft balance that the Eagles strike between country and rock on the classic, \"Desperado.\" 4.5/5\n",

In the nose, there is a nice helping of tropical fruit and citrus and dank hops, along with hints of floral, perfume and leafy aromas. Very inviting. In the taste, the tropical fruit flavors along with a grapefruit zest hit the tongue. However, the palate becomes considerably drier as the drink progresses. A hops forward pale ale; semi sharp pine, subtle prickliness, and with a lovely mild to moderate bitterness that is just right and coexists beautifully with the juiciness.

Not the easiest 6%-ish pale to throw back, but if you're craving dank hops with a lighter malt-backbone, this might hit the spot.\n",

      "This IPA from Great Divide is bright and entirely clear though on the darker side, coppery dark orange leaning red. The head stays at about one finger's height, perhaps a hair more, very well, and the lacing left behind is think, clumpy and plentiful, dropping down to some intricate webbing at its slightest. The aroma is strong with hops and very giving. They're up front on the nose and clearly the focus, with some bready, somewhat toasty malts just there for balance. Aside from some pine resin, it takes on an earthy rawness, sort of herbal and not-quite-spicy, with some leafy mint contributing. On the tongue, though, the hops really hit home. It's dank and earthy, lots of leaf and herb, while some grapefruit and orange peel bring citrus character into it. Malts are again crusty and dryish, maybe a hint of caramel in there. Some of the almost cheesecloth notes I get from particular breweries (Fat Head's in particular) are present. I'm wondering if Amarillo is part of the bill, as lots of fresh but not hot mint leaf makes its way out. Pithy but not too much, and balanced between juicy and dry, this beer offers plenty. The body is medium with some heft and depth to it, revealing a couple layers on the tongue as it rolls smoothly over, almost silky without giving up a strong crispness all the way from beginning to end.\n",

S: Sewery dank grapefruit, bitter citrus, some spicy yeast ester is peeking around the edges. T: It's very smooth and bitter at the same time. Smelling is same as tasting here. malt is middling malt like caramel but lighter roast. Bitter citrus is yielding to minor piney notes. Complex. resinous on a ephemeral level, very mild. M: creamy as all get out. carbonation reminds me of nitro carb. bittering hops are very present on final swallow. out breath is spicy hop citrus. O: it is definitely a big fresh hop ale. Those dusty, dank resinous new hop notes present a nice complex hop brew.\n",

      "Bottle date best by Dec 30, 2013 Pours a super clean orange with thin white head Aroma- big grassy hop resin, musty mango, citrus rind, flower pedal  Taste- juicy and resinous: juicy grapefruit and orange with subtle tropical fruit, earthy wet hop resin surfaces in the middle with sweet bready malt, finishes quite dank and sticky with piney/oily hop resin and traces of citrus Feel- big for a pale ale, sticky, resinous, balanced Well I am so pleasantly surprised by this. I was quite disappointed with last year's release (in fact, I kept coming across a similar very astringent grassy note in many of their beers that threw me off, not the case here). This is a great wet-hopped beer with all the right resiny, oily hoppy goodness. Well done Great Divide\n",

      "A - Poured a copper, light gold, with a very small head that disappeared fairly quickly.  S - Very subtle on the noise, citrus hops, piney, fresh peeled oranges.. very very subtle. T - Slight bitterness, pine, orange, extremely balanced. However, I feel this is missing something? But considering this is 55 IBUS it can be hoppy at times. M - Nice carbonation, slight tingling sensation on the palate, silky, smooth, refreshing. Very nicely done with this part O - This is a finely crafted beer that is superbly light on the palate. Very drinkable, it goes down very smooth, it covers the palate and very enjoyable.. My only complaint about this brew is I wish more of the hop, dank, sweetness and pine notes would have come through. I understand this brew is not meant to be the boldest IPA. Great divide went for balance and I must say they got very close to perfect. I just wish more smell was present. If you served this to me with any other IPA this would not stand out, until I tasted it. However, this is a very nice balanced IPA, probably the best I've had in the taste category. And is a variety break from the darker, heavier brews in the Autumn season. Cheers!\n",

Solid two fingers of white head with decent retention. Leaves a lot of lacing around the glass.  Smell: A bright and juicy hop forward aroma with plenty of grassy and citrus hop hints. Upfront earthy and herbal hops with good hints of wet grass and floral hints. Dank pine resin scent. Citrus hops with juicy hints of grapefruit, orange peel, mango, tangerine, lemon zest, pineapple, and apricot. Solid bready malt background with hints of sweet caramel, grains, cracker, and yeast. A very solid fresh hop aroma.  Taste: Like it smells, a nicely ripe and chewy hop presence with lots of grassy, floral, and citrus hop notes. Big taste of wet grassy hops upfront with some floral notes. A good taste of dank and spicy pine resin. Juicy citrus hops with notes of grapefruit, orange pulp, tangerine, mango, pineapple, lemons, and apricot. Hops are nicely bitter and oily. Good backing malt presence with notes of sweet caramel, grains, cracker, and yeast. A very good fresh and wet hop taste. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Very juicy and wet. Fairly oily. Finishes pretty dry. Overall: A very good fresh hopped take on the American Pale Ale style. Very grassy and juicy with a nice smooth medium body.\n",

Pungent herbal, grassy and dank pine needle hops with a malty backbone of raw grain, stale bread. Very raw and earthy, the aroma is slightly above average in power for a pale. Steady bready and cracker malt, thin but enough to support a wave of pine, fresh cut grass and dank herbal hop flavors. Bitterness is toned and lifting leading to a drying feeling, stickiness with a pine aftertaste. Good body and carbonation. Alcohol is well hidden. Dries pretty well. Drinkable and smooth. All in all this is a solid drink, malts are raw and earthy and I expected a bit more boldness from a fresh hop beer. We can't forget that this is only a pale ale so it competes well for the style.\n",

The flavor definitely picks up that dank grassiness in a big overwhelming way. There is some fruitiness in the finish as well. Mouthfeel is decent with good amount of carbonation. IMO it drinks heavy for what I would classify an APA. Ultimately it just didn't do it for me. Lacked nothing in terms of flavor but the flavor just didn't work on my palate.

Very dank, with a grassy note, pine, lemon and spices. Some malty carmael along with pale malts, and a little sugar also. Taste - Classic dry, fresh hops mixed with pale malts. Bitter, sweet and piney. Loads of lemon, farmhouse/grassy. Added sugars give it nice sweetness. Very herbal, with some citric flavor. Malts are bold, caramel and pale flavored. Not much alcohol presence at all.  Mouthfeel - Dry bitterness coats tounge with the fresh hops. Malts add the caramel and pale follow up. Palate gets more of the same with lots of pine and herbal, and sugars. Aftertaste is dry, bitter, malty and sweet. Overall - A well done, tasty beer. Love the 1 2 punch of hops, then malts. Very balanced and easy to drink. Good price, easy enough to find, worth the purchase for sure.\n",

Nose is citrusy/tropical, bright pine, and a little woodsy berry, though a little more tropical (pulpy pineapple) than I typically get from Mosaic; not much by way of malts on the nose. Taste brings the hop pungency out and turns it up, melding the different notes together so none of them really dominate...really nice juicy bitterness, that dries out at the end. Crisp, juicy, moderate body...maybe a little thinner in terms of feel (but not flavor) than is ideal for me.

S- Dank and sticky herbal presence off the top from the big hops with sweet stone fruits, onions, passionfruit, citrus and tropical hops as well. Medium hop aromatic strength; not pungent. Hints at sweetness with pale cereal grains providing balance. T- Matches the aroma with a very similar profile here as the hops once again lead the war between Lizards, Unicorns and Ninjas. The passionfruit intensifies and opens things up with strong notes of bubble gum, mango and nectarine balanced out with pine, orange, cereal grain, yeast bread and pineapple. The hops are strong but overall the flavor profile feels a bit on the light side. MF- Light overall body that leans just a bit toward a medium thickness. The texture is crisp with a slight creaminess; just a tad watery. Ends with a light herbal bitterness. Plenty of Mosaic hops in this Pale Ale. For whatever it leans a bit towards the dank oniony side of the hop's character but it is still tasty with a balance of different fruity hop flavors. The body is just a bit thin.\n",

Overall a pleasant bouquet of aromas that is understated and not intense. In the mouth it is medium to light bodied with a smooth and almost creamy feel. The gentle carbonation provides a soft tingle. In the beginning, it actually tastes quite clean and with a wet malt feel. However, the flavors soon begin to open up and provide multiple layers. There is pear, lemon and grapefruit zest in both the taste and the finish. In the outer layer, there is a grassy, herbal and pine resin that coats the mouth and provides a moderate spice and bitterness.

Smell: As you would expect from a beer that is single hopped with Mosaic, the aroma bursts out of the glass with the earthy dankness that is the hallmark of mosaic hops. Maybe a bit of clove/baking spice in there but this is definitely a dank bomb. Taste: Dankness carries through onto the palate with a little pine on the back end but overall it has a very light bitterness. Single hopped beers can have a tendency to be a bit uni-dimensional in flavor and I think this beer does suffer slightly from being a bit lacking in depth. Mouthfeel: Solid medium minus on the mouthfeel. Nice and drinkable but I don't know if I'd quite call it crushable. Overall(Style Points): At 6% Pipeworks calls this beer a Pale Ale, not an IPA and I would concur with that. It has tons of Mosaic aroma but its a little light on Flavor and Mouthfeel. 90 Points.\n",

This beer pours a clear, medium copper amber colour, with four fat fingers of puffy, rocky, and mildly creamy off-white head, which leaves some streaky and sudsy lace around the glass as it lazily recedes. It smells of slightly dank pine resin, bready and crackery caramel malt, mixed exotic citrus peel notes, green onion, and further leafy, earthy, and perfumed floral green hop bitters. The taste is orange, white grapefruit, and lemon citrus rind, gritty pale malt, saltine crackers, a fading caramel sweetness, some herbaceous dankness, muddled tropical fruit, and more weedy, floral, and spicy hoppiness. The carbonation is adequate for the task at hand, via its plebeian frothiness, the body a decent middleweight, and mostly smooth, just a touch of scallion-like acerbity fiddling about. It finishes trending dry, the maltiness ebbing, and the fruity and verdant hops holding the line. Overall, this a pleasant enough west coast pale ale, the various hop esters keeping my palate's due attention.

Mouth feel feels little harsh in the carbonation for my liking, but still good. Overall, a great pale ale. I think the aromas are quite nice coming out of this beer. Served in a 12oz snifter.\n",

A: Appealing orange-amber with 1-2 fingers of off-white head with average retention and a clingy stripe of lacing at the top of the mug. S: Pineapple, grapefruit, melon, and berries along with floral and some grassy herbal notes. Pale malty aromas are mildly grainy with a little bit of cracker. T: Explosive flavor with huge grapefruit, pineapple, orange/tangerine, and honeydew melon in the finish. Grassy, herbal slightly dank aftertaste. A tiny bit of onion sneaks in with some warming. Pale maltiness is a bit crackery but not at all caramelly or sweet. No yeast or alcohol character. Moderately bitter. M: Clean with a dry finish and medium body. Easy to drink.  O: A superb APA from BP -- this ranks as a style leader along with Calico for Amber and Yellowtail for a Kolsch. The hoppiness is intense but quenching. Stellar beer but price is high here at least $15 for 6 pack cans). BP adjust your prices.\n",

The smell is sweet; the citrus/orange like sweetness immediately hits the nose, the tropical fruits abound. There is also some dank resiny hops aroma as well as toasted malt. This drink is medium bodied and smooth. It is crispy on the tongue. It is a hops forward taste; the grapefruit zest is there, and quite delicious, some faint lemon, as well as piny hops. The bitterness is sharp but manageable. There is a faint toasted malts backbone that is balancing. The finish is dry, hoppy and puckering. Overall, I really liked this one, it was quite tasty.

Whoa, those aromas are different, and I am not sure in a good way: a combo of pepper, caramel malt, green onion and pine poke at my nostrils. The dank scents are back with a vengeance on the palate, huge green onion and pine profile. It almost becomes minty by the finish. And oh...that finish, slightly herbal and sweet from the malt. The sweet is what derails this trip for me, unbalanced. The beer is a little lighter feeling than I would personally like, and more slick than creamy. This range of flavors does not mesh well: green onion, tea-like, pine, caramel malt. It does not flow. I am sure others may find this beer refreshing, just not for me.\n",

Smells of resinous, dank, and grassy fresh hops. Get some herbal characteristics, along with pine, sugary grapefruit, tiny bit of tangerine, and plenty of floral. A very nice, clean carmel malt is detected as well. Taste immediately starts with a resinous, grassy hop flavor, but is quickly balanced out by a sugary grapefruit flavor. The middle continues the sweetness, this time bringing a carmel sweetness. This is balanced with more resinous, herbal hop qualities, along with some grapefruit and tangerine. The finish is really good and makes this beer. Get more resinous qualities, but are more of the bitter variety. This bitterness is tame, however, and is accompanied with more intense notes of grapefruit, grass, and tropical fruits. It seems to start off with more fresh hop qualities and finishes with more juicy, fruity hop qualities. All the while balanced with a sweet, clean, and bready malt backbone. Very clean, crisp, and surprisingly full mouthfeel for a pale ale. Although it has a fuller body, it still drinks likes a session ale and leaves you wanting more. A very well-crafted fresh hop pale ale. I wish the hop harvest was year round because this is awesome.\n",

Its more like Bass, but not as rounded in the malt dept. (Bass has a touch more caramel malt). Most Pale ale people have gone whole-hog into the citrus/floral and even dank (refer to American beers loaded with Columbus circa 7-10 years ago). I digress...for what it is...its pretty good. I am trying to think of a non-British, English IPA that I like better...and ? I can't seem to think of any. If you can't find Bass, Smithwicks, or Whitbread at your local store/pub and want something English...you would hard pressed to find anything better!  Last Words? It is what it is!\n",

Very lively and fresh appearance with a husky, all white foam cap and excellent coverage. A very bold aroma of tangy citrus, pine sap, lemmon zest, strawberry, peach puree, and old herbs and spice combo. A cleanly sweet and field grain style malt aroma brings it all together.  Such a crispy, clean malty profile. Light, golden style malt, maybe medium bodied at the most with a honey-dipped white bread and earthy grains all over the place. This is an excellent malt flavor and the extra jazzy mouthfeel from the bottle conditioning really sets it off. After the shock and awe of the malty complexity, the hops, the El Dorado single hop just crushes the taste buds. For an APA, this thing is loaded with hoppy depth. Multiple layers of flavors flow in and out: At first, its a raw, earthy kick, like dried grains of the field, dank herbals, spicy citrus and sweet wild berries. The earthy-dry and then juicy sweet fruitiness duality really digs in deep. Rather impressive depth from just this one single hop.  Amazing drinkability, excellent depth in the malt and multi colored hop taste makes it a tiny beautiful something (APA).\n",

      "Basic finger’s worth of bright white foam, airy and openly knit so the retention is below average but pretty while it’s there, the lacing is slight and tends to slowly slide off. The liquid has that soft haze like drowsily staring at the sun, yellow rust hue, the bubbles are on the larger side and very broadly arrayed, no beads. Lots of snap in the angular nose, grapefruit pith, sea salt, sourdough bread crusts, pine cone and apricot pits, dry sort of florality, not dank or very leafy yet likewise outside of some cocoa powder not overtly malty either, it has a very breezy feel and just drifts off nonchalantly. In the mouth it’s medium-bodied and its dryness verges on arch but in the final analysis has it just briskly erect. Carbonation is strong, not pushy. You get a fuller range of orange and lemon to white grapefruit citrus here, none of that sugary approach to this element though. Mild apple, apricot, white grape fruit. Stiffened further by unmown green grass and as much pepper as salt accents. That cocoa here gives it an Ovaltine finish that is more textural than flavorful.

Very balanced with a biscuit like breaded malt base. Smooth aftertaste.  A lot fuller bodied than you would expect for a 4.2% beer. Carbonation seems about right. Just a bit prickly. Has some resin slickness This one isnt quite up there amongst the Zombie Dusts, Alpha Kings, Red Chairs, or Dale's of the world as a straight up Pale Ale, but at 1.5-2% lower abv or more than every other, it is probably in a league of it's own.

A - Three fingers of creamy white foam slowly settle to a thick, chunky cap, leaving stray splotches of lace behind. Transparent golden body, with a plethora of tiny bubbles rising up the middle of the glass. S - All Simcoe, all the time, as far as the hops go. Tropical fruits, citrus, touch of dank and onion. A bit of doughy malt shows through. Smell is a tad muted initially although it intensifies as the beer warms up - initially a 4.0 but eventually a 4.5. T - Peach and tropical fruit juice, some late tangerine, a bit of pine and dankness, and extremely mild sugary malt character. Low-to-moderate bitterness that does grow a touch over the course of a glass.  M - Surprisingly active carbonation considering this growler was filled over two weeks ago. Silky smooth medium-light body, with plenty of mouth-coating hop oils in the finish. Quite refreshing. D - This is ridiculous. Could substitute for water. I'm kind of hoping none of my friends stop by to try this, as I could easily put away the entire 2L. I'm actually a tad surprised this is almost 6% - other than a slow-growing buzz there's nothing to suggest any alcohol content at all.

The beer pours a nice clear faint copper color, hints of orange when held to the light, a nice finger of soapy head sits atop the beer that has fair retention but leaves behind some nice sticky lacing around the glass. The aroma is extremely dank and very resinous. Big sticky pine, what I can only describe as cat pee with some bright citrus at the end, that is cut very well with some rich bready malt. The aroma is so pungent and just bursts out of the glass, really shows off the Simcoe hop. The flavors are great, big pine presence, nice grapefruit and something more tropical papaya with a really dry bitter dirty earthiness at the end that also brings out some soft malt. It's really incredible what can come out of a single hop, my hats off to Vinnie. The body is pretty thin, higher than anticipated carbonation that is a bit too prickly at times, but on the whole is pretty on par with most pale ales. Verdict: Fantastic pale ale from Russian River. Currently a draft and growler only option, but soon to be available in bottles and I can not be more excited. For anyone near the brewery, this is worth the trip!\n",

      "Yeah, this is old as the date on the bottom of the can read 10/4/17 and yes, I have a ton of beer to get through here at my house. With that being said, I wasn't sure why this was rated so high. Maybe it's the name on the label or the nature of the hopping but overall, this was an average beer that didn't stand out in any particular way to me, even if there was hardly any sediment from it being in my basement for all this time... Not a bad pour to this as the liquid was a deep apricot with enough fluffy head to top it off. Quite cloudy, only a bit of sediment floated in it and hardly any light got in around the edges. Very little soapy lacing was seen along the back of my pint glass as I worked my way through this, which was a bit of a surprise. Loads of Mosaic, dankness, grass, and forest in the muted nose as they all came through in the taste. Nothing heavy here and the Barley stood out more than anything else in the taste, as this felt quite full but uninspiring at the same time. A lack of easily discernible bitterness stood out to me as this went right down and although it wasn't bad, it needed quite a bit more to stand out from Trillium's other offerings that I've had. Not a lot of booze here either as this was the epitome of what a generic American Pale Ale is, in my eyes. I need to get a fresh can of this but given how well their other offerings have held up well over time, this one was a bit of a letdown. I prefer the regular Fort Point and know that it's me, and not them, when it comes to how low I rated this. Needs another go before I fully write it off!\n",

      "Thank you Jon for hooking me up with this one! Pint can dated 10/04/18 pink dot. Poured into a tulip at 44f Pours a pretty hazy, rich honey golden, with a fluffy, two-finger ever-so-slightly off-white head, slowly slinking down to small patchy islands of film, and a little collar. Some spotty lacing. Absolutely beautiful color. Nose is dank dank dank Mosaic hops. That dark fruit/berry aroma, with a big impression of passionfruit and over-ripe mango. Some Meyer lemon action in there as well. Sweet, dank, and tropical fruity. Very Mosaic. Palate is very dank. There is a fragile malt backbone, providing just a touch of sweetness, but the hops are the star of the show here. The malt here is just enough of a platform to securely showcase the huge Mosaic dry hopping headline. Big dankness. That passionfruit is much more muted on the palate, with more of a berry/starfruit/mango vibe. It is still fruity, but the scale is tipped way in favor the dank side. A very restrained bitterness comes in towards the finish, taking this fruity dankness, and drying it out to chalky proportions. Balanced. Uber hoppy. This drinks way more like an IPA than an APA. Mouthfeel is crisp, but medium bodied. It has some good heft to it. A lot of body for the ABV. It's soft and super juicy up front, and then the dryness comes in on the finish, drying it out very fast. Carbonation is medium and strong, and gives it a little bit of lift. Overall, this is a fantastic pale ale. It has so much flavor. I don't think you could make this anymore flavorful. The Mosaic dry-hopping is great. The quintessential essence of Mosaic. The nose is to die for, and the feel is great. Absolute Mosaic flavor bomb. My first offering from Trillium, and I'm impressed. Scored a touch low, because I still have some killer beers to review (Galaxy Cutting Tiles) and I didn't want to over-rate myself into a corner. This is fantastic. If you love Mosaic like I do, you need this.\n",

      "Canned 11/15. A nice murky honey-tea color with a tall, tall poofy head of 3 fingers. Tons of gobs of lace left behind.  Such a refreshing nose. Should be made into a summer candle. Effervescence of pear, spritzer, honey, apple, melon, and lemon float up to the nose in an ocean wave-like wafting. Ever so slight dank at the tail end of the nose.  Flavor is juicy, although I can tell it has faded just a touch as there's some notes that I can sense the shadow of but not quite full-on. Nice pineapple, banana peel, oranges, bubble gum, starfruit, and mango all form together for a soft but easy profile.  Feel is creamy and soft all the way, and has a nice resiny touch at the finish.  Overall, I've had more than my fair share of Trillium beers and they possess a softness and supple quality that no other brewer has yet to accomplish. Such a treat. Love my Trilliums.\n",

      "Canned on 11/15/17 Opened on 12/6/17 Pours out a rather sexy orange hued gold with yellow highlights. Hazy...practically opaque with a white, bubbly foam matter that fizzles slow. Only the slightest scattering of foam andva minimal but present ring around tge edge of the glasd remains.  The nose is overwhelmed by dank hops....freshly crushed up whole cone hops, very earthy....wet forest on a mid july morning, herbal and spicy, hefty grains of the harvest, lightly sweet fruity notes, grandma's spice rack and a sweet, but light honey bite from the malt. Extraordinary. This Pale Ale certainly gives many ipa's a \"run for the money\" in hop-complexity. A very freshly harvested hop flavor proves to be impressive, green, leafy veggies, mango, starfruit, pineapple juice all seem to be within the earthy and herbal dominated hop affect. Spring water and herbal malty flavor seems rather odd....herbs, veggies and hearty grains make up the pale malt flavor. Tangy wheat malt with seriously sweet and sour fruits and herbs sums it up well. A very low...almost void-of bitterness style hop edge seems just a bit strange. Thr hops seem very fresh, but also mild in the finish, perhaps an effect of tge mosaic strain being the dry hopped choice?  Layers of flavor's from the hops happen in subtle ways, from tropical juice of starfruit and pineapple, to earthy, sour herbs. The layers are also obvious in the mouthfeel, juicy medium body, dry and peppery middle with a long, malty and juicy finish.  Favorite aspect is the seriously fresh tasting hop complexity, with earthy and non-bitter tropucal fruit notes. A very melliw vibe with multiple layers of complexity. Odd and interesting.\n",

      "Thank you to my friends at Carmine Street Tap Room. I will always patronize an establishment that just does't sell beer, they love it. There is something pleasant about balancing the undeniable greatness of bitterness. This is something that Trillium might do better than any other brewer. Bitter is the quintessential taste that complexity finds in mastery. Well done. L: Thick like honey appearance S: Tropical almost cherry served the middle of a grapefruit T: Great fruity upfront, lingers to bitter rinds of melon, to a hint of dough, to the last drops of squeezed by hand creme  brûlée grapefruit finish F: Lighter than I expected, almost session like. Clean, with dank undertones O: Trillium is a masterful brewery, this mosaic dry hopped Fort Point pale ale is a highlight in my beer repertoire. A special note: Somehow, Trillium with their simplistic use of generic canning, with a stick and peel label, wins the packaging award of 2017.\n",

Some of the Trillium beers can lean towards a milky/murky haze, but this one is quite orange juicy looking. Minimal retention or lacing.  S -- Trillium does an amazing job here of coaxing out the unique mosaic aroma profile: blueberry, mango, papaya, honey, peach, and a mild earthy dankness. Incredibly pungent and nuanced.  T -- Mango, passionfruit, orange rind, crackery malts F -- Dry, with an almost puckering finish. Good flavor balances, decent carb. Medium mouthfeel O -- Another great Fort Point variant.

T: Largely follows nose with mango, passionfruit, and maybe a bit of peach, along with light citrus, some barley malt just to hold it all together and keep the bitterness from running amok, and a finish of moderate dank earth. Very very good. F: Medium bodied, kinda chewy. Light to medium carbonation. Taste lingers as drying is minimal, but you want this taste to linger. Fabulous construction and balance.

Nose has some hint of tropical fruit and a bit of dank, but I was expecting much more from the mosaic dry hopping - improves some as the beer warms. Taste has a nice mix of earthy, tropical, apricot, unripe peach and a hint of pineapple, a little dank at the end -- none dominating the other. Finishes with a nice lingering hoppy bitterness. Fairly dry in a good way. I am not blown away, but overall a very nice pale ale.\n",

      "A complex bouquet of tropical fruits immediately attacks the nose with deep undertones of Mosaic-derived candied fruits: hefty doses of passion fruit, papaya, mango, and guava leap out of the glass with each sip, reminding you of Trillium's mastery with the humble hops plant. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Where the intense mosaic bouquet ascended your olfactory sensation toward the heavens, the Columbus brings you back down to earth; tons of resinous pine, dank grass, onions, adjoined with some of the finer floral and herbal notes produce the back drop to the initial fruity surge. Mild caramel and some light grainy notes from the malt surface as the brew is given time to warm up and breathe. Juice. If the palatal profile of this beer were a three-part essay, the thesis statement would be tropical/candied fruits with conjectures hypothesizing on the existence of citrus rinds; the crux of the main body would be something akin to low-pulp Tropicana orange juice, with evidence backed up by hints of grapefruit; and this wonderful zythological essay would definitely have a dank, yet somewhat mildly bitter conclusion accentuated by more earthy, grassy notes with hints of herbal plagiarism here and there. I don't understand how it's possible to express such a complex aromatic/palatal profile without the brew becoming some sort of thick sloppy goop, but this brew is most certainly medium-light bodied. Before you have time to ponder the slight creamy sensation lingering on the tip of your lips, the lively tongue-tickling carbonation and the bone-dry finish reminds you it's time for another sip.\n",

Mango and guava with dank undertones. Medium bodied and creamy. A bit velvety. Zero bitterness or malt on the palate with waves of fresh, juicy hops. Peachy and dank.

Nose super musty dank Mosaic hop, pine sap, a little oniony, orange rind, a little tropical note, horseradish?! spicy hop, a little papaya note, but not a lot of tropical, plenty of orange juice citrus as well. Taste brings more pine sap hops, a little orange rind, more mild oniony Mosaic, again a touch of horseradish like character, plenty of rind, with mild tropical papaya musty thing, a little mango skin, orange tangerine flesh, spicy herbal hops, a little candy sweet malt, sticky even which is weird because I don't remember that from any other Fort Points. Finish is a little sticky sweet, little pine sap and onion lingering, just weird mosaic. Mouth is med bod, decent carb. Overall... I really don't understand how people love mosiac, its pine sap and green onion, so nasty, yeah some mild tropical notes but there are so many better hops for that, the hops just destroyed the base Fort Point.\n",

Great staying power on this beer. Head drops down to thick cap and leaves thick lacing on the glass. Smell: Lots of sweet oranges in the hop profile from the Columbus hops. The mosaic adds a nice dank kick to the hop profile. Signature trillium house yeast. Smells fantastic. Taste: On point with the nose. The backdrop of this beer is all sweet oranges and mangos with a dank mosiac hop kick. Light bitterness throughout the beer with light lingering bitterness in the finish.  Mouthfeel: light bodied beer with moderate carbonation. Creamy carbonation present. This beer has a juicy and oily character that makes for a luxurious feel on the palate, but it adds more body to this pale ale. I would prefer this to be more drinkable.

Wide ring with large bubbles stays around dropping small sheets and spotty lacing. S- Dank herbs and tropical fruits ala Mosaic make for a particularly stanky brew, in a good way. A mix of passionfruit, melon and mango in the forefront with floral, herbal, citrus like tangerine and grapefruit, mint and orange juice hops. Just the hops as a hint of pale grains pales in the background. T- See the aroma description and carry it over here adding a bit more pale cereal grain and some yeast bread in the base. Again the passionfruit, mango, apricot and general stone tropical fruit madness leading up to weedy herbal and floral tones. Tangerine and orange juice open up more with time. Dankness.

The citrus is there, mostly as pith, along with some malt sweetness. Lots of earthy, musty, dank hops but no real flavour popping, just earthy dank. The finish is fairly bitter, but again, more orange peel pith than the fruit or oils. Actually quite messy.  M - Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, soft mouthfeel.

A: Peachy orange amber with 1-2 finger, off-white frothy head with good retention and a thin line of lace at the top of the glass. S: Strong pine resin, dank grassiness, and sharp citrus grapefruit rind and lemon on a lightly caramel but mostly bready malt base. T: The flavor is less bready and malty and more sharply bitter than an APA should be. The malt base has mostly medium caramel but not enough crackery or bready character to balance the overly sharp citric bitterness. The hops component is lemony, grapefruit pith, piney and dank and bracingly, almost minerally bitter when tasted with the not sweet enough maltiness. Yeast and alcohol are not present -- it is a little too much bitterness despite the low IBUs. The caramel malt base and the sharp hops don't work well together for me. M: Clean but very, very dry with medium-high carbonation and light-medium body.

Ripe orange, pineapple, mango, papaya, melon. Follows into piney bitterness. A decent pale malt backbone to finish slightly sweeter than IPA. (4.0) Feel: Medium bodied. Moderate carbonation. No alcohol detected. Malt body clears off the bitterness. A little sweetness left on the tongue. Slightly lower rating due to the expense of the higher ABV (3.5) Overall: A great pale ale. It's old but remains new-age and dry-hopped. Tons of hop flavors and aromas. Due to the alcohol and hops, you could almost call this an IPA, but there is enough malt body to reach the pale ale balance. I would describe it as a dry-hopped IPA with an even stronger pale malt backbone to clean it off. If it were truly a pale ale, I would give it outstanding reviews for flavor, however with the dry-hopping and creeping ABV, the rating slips a bit as I have to evaluate it more as an IPA. Still a great beer that remains great even in today's hop craze. (Final Rating: 3.9)\n",

      "Cloudy off orange color, one finger of white head reduces to a cap, plenty of visible carbonation, good lacing. Aroma is a mix of dank hops and sweet malt,some earthiness. Taste is well balanced between the hops and malt, malt starts out sweet with a slight honey flavor with a solid dose of orange zest. Mouthfeel is medium, brisk carbonation moves the flavors along nicely. Reminds me of Jai Alai but a touch more palatable, worth trying.\n",

      "Traded for this a long time ago, as the date on the bottom of the can read 12/21/16. Yes, I know this was old but it poured decently and only had a hint of sediment floating at the bottom of the liquid. Much of this turned into a malt bomb for me but even the flavors that I was able to discern weren't quite like the beer's stated profile. Thankfully, this was easygoing and easy to drink during a night where I was going through a lot of older stuff in my basement! The pour and appearance were the best aspects of this beer as the cloudy, goldenrod hue, massive fluffy head, and thick, rocky sheets of lacing left behind were all quite pleasing and complementary to each other. Lots of lemon, spice, banana, and tangerine juice in the muted nose as the citrus came out more in the taste. A strong floral taste came through as this fully warmed up as this felt a bit Belgian in tone although there wasn't a ton of funk or farmhouse spice to be had. Slick like citrus juice, there was some mild dankness and stone fruit rind in the aftertaste that made this feel a bit heavier than I would have liked once I finished it off. Beers don't get much easier to drink than this as this quite the session ale. A bit more of a hop presence and body would have made this a great American Pale Ale but as it was, it wasn't overwhelming or disappointing. Would be great to give this another go with a fresher can!\n",

Bright golden-yellow (almost neon depending on the light) hue, moderate head. Slightly dank in the best way. Aroma of citrus and pine; taste of mango, orange, apricot and peach. Lots of peach. Impressed by how long the aroma sticks around after the initial pour. Nice bready sweetness from the malt balances the taste; finishes without any lingering bitterness or stickiness that coats the palette.

Taste is highlighted once again by juicy peach and pineapple flavors. Grapefruit and dank are there too. There is a tiny lemon kick towards the finish. Get some grass and light resin bitterness as the beer dries out. High light body. Crisp and somewhat creamy. Clean finish. I really enjoyed this pale ale. It's juicy, fruity, and smoothly bitter.

A hazy golden-amber hue with plenty of chunky sediment and light carbonation. Yields a large head of creamy white foam that lasts for a few minutes before reducing to a patchy surface layer. Slight lacing. S: Aroma of sweet malt and intense hops with hints of pine, weed, citrus, grass/hay, grain, earthy yeast, a twinge of rye and stewed hops. Lovely. T: Tastes of bountiful aromatic hops with a sharp bitter finish. Notes of pine resin, dank weed, orange peel, mild grapefruit, citrus, grass/hay, grainy malt, pepperiness, earthy yeast, a hint of rye and stewed hops. Slightly sweet, followed by a strident hoppy bitterness upon swallowing. M: Mouthfeel is smooth and tingly, with soft carbonation and good body. Pretty astringent, accompanied by an aftertaste of piny aromatic hops, bitterness, earthy yeast and mild grain. O: A tasty American pale ale that goes down a treat. Looks OK, while the aroma and flavour are wonderfully hop-laden. Grainy malt and yeast notes provide a subtle backbone. Decent body - could be a tad livelier.

Comes with a one finger white head, relatively average retention for the style with a fair bit of lacing. Again, this is a very hazy yellow brew, almost opaque but isn't. S- Juicy grapefruits mixed in with a distinct rye scent, some crackers and bread. Its not complex but quite citrusy, I'm grinning as I'm smelling this beer. Some caramel from the pale malt, but make no mistake, this is quite citrusy and I did not expect this to smell this good. F- Citrusy grapefruits up front, rye bread in the middle, with a slightly dank resinous hop flavour on the backend that is not particularly bitter. This is quite nice- not complex but somehow well-executed and delivers a nice mix of citrus hoppiness with the rye and pale malts beneath.  M- Medium body, not lacking in body but could use a little more carbonation. Has a dank finish that isn't sticky or resinous or dry, I'm not sure how I'd describe it- it's somewhere in the middle if that makes sense. Not particularly clean/dry, but not particularly sticky/resinous. O- Westbrook definitely does a great job with the execution of their beers. Just another well-executed brew in their regular lineup.

Hoppy, resinous flavors upfront: lemon, apricot, mango, and a bit of pine...all spicy and oily. There's an interesting fresh, almost minty quality that leads to a crisp finish. Just a little cracker malts underneath, but the overall focus is on the zesty-spicy-fresh combo of hops and rye. Medium-light and snappy...super easy to drink. Such a shame Westbrook doesn't supply NC with their delicious beverages (yet). This could be a staple in my fridge.\n",

Flavor brings through a much stronger, pine, sap, dank flavor which is absolutely into IPA territory. Where oats are normally used to bring a creamy mouthfeel, here they simply get out of the way of the hops, which provide a resinous texture in my mouth. This is a great dank IPA, unlike any I have had for a long time, though it just happens to be an oat pale ale.\n",

From the initial nose, I get swaths of pine, citrus, and a bit of spice--plenty of hard hop notes though. Tastes of rich herbal pungent tropical fruit bitterness with an undertone of caramel and a sweetness from the malt base. I rarely use the work \"dank\" to describe a beer profile, but this may be pretty fitting. The highlight of this beer is definitely the usage of oats with the pale malts, a great combination and an absolutely joyus mouthfeel. To me, this beer would fit under an IPA in most accounts coming in at 8.4% ABV. I do enjoy the nice flavor and aromas from the Equinox hops. A nice earthy, pine, cedar touch which I like. Overall, a solid beer but certainly not anything spectacular or mind-blowing. An enjoyable and unique style brewed by Lagunitas.\n",

      "22oz bomber to my FW Imperial Nonic glass Notes taken on 06/12/2015 A: The Equinox pours a light amber body that looks the color of caramel candy. A touch of hop haze strikes across the body and a massive ecru head forms over top. Displays some impeccable stay power here while a few clumpy swaths of lace are left tracking behind in intervals.  S: Juicy herbals and tropical fruits like tangerine with kiwi come together with a light spice and spikes of melon and grapefruit. There is some underlying pale malt sweetness to this but it’s not at all obtrusive. Becoming more and danker to me with a lemony herbal quality and a touch of medicinals mixed in. Very solid aromatics with a fresh tropical fruit vibe. T: A super easy drinker with some big hop flavor. Hits first with a resinous musky herb note, citrus juice, grapefruit zest, white melon, and tropical flowers. Malt plays the supporting role here with a light spur of toasted grains to help hold it all together. Very smooth overall with the alcohol completely masked. Finishes with more citrus and dank resins.  M: Incredibly smooth feel on the tongue with a crisp finish and some lasting hop linger. Falls mid-level in body but rides very slick on the palate. There is an upper moderate amount of constricting bitterness to it as it dries out the ending a bit.  D: Yet another solid brew from Lags. Has a great hop flavor punch to it that hauled along that smoothened Oat body. Equinox with Simcoe looks to be a winning combo. I can dig on this Pale Oat Ale any day.\n",

L: A medium super hazy yellow gold color with a nice two finger white head. Decent glass lacing. S: Unlike a lot of other reviewers, I'm getting a ton of dankness on the nose. Aromas of weed, onion, mint, vegetal notes mix with the citrus. A candy sweetness can be detected, but boy to me this is one dank smelling beer. T: Different from the nose from the dry hopping, on the taste I get a lot more of the fruit and less of the dankness. Loads of pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit, some mango and tropical fruits also. Still I get a bit of the dank pine and forest flavors as the candy like sweetness softens it out to finish with a fruity dry and slightly bitter flavor. No alcohol tasted at all, but with that ABV it's not surprising. F: Medium mouthfeel, smooth and dry but not overly prickly or bitter and as I said no alcohol. Carbonation is spot on. O: A really good beer, but not what I expected. I'm really glad I picked this version up as it was way different that I thought it would be, but still really good.

It has a beautiful golden color that lightens on the edges, and with a good pour leaves a perfect amount of head. The smell wasn't too pleasant for me, as smelled a bit dank for my liking, but the taste more than made up for it. There is a slight remainder of the smell, but the beer itself is beautifully balanced and easy to drink. At 5.5% alcohol, it's not too strong, but it builds a lot of character and flavor from the first sip. The mouth feel is quite near perfect. The viscosity perfectly suits the type of beer and the flavors.  I think overall this beer tastes fantastic, looks fantastic, and its worst attribute (for me) was the smell. I think the thing I really thought was great about this beer, upon reflection, that it's great for sipping slowly, but the body, AC, and flavor profile also allow you to down it quickly, if the situation calls for it.\n",

      "Drank from a 22 fl oz (1 pint 6 fl oz) bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA Bottled on 05/08/18 Served in a tulip Cloudy, light yellow ochre appearance. The opaque body was topped by a small, bubbly, off-white crown that quickly dissolved. A tiny, frothy halo encircled the liquid. Spotty, streaky lacing trickled along the glass. The aroma was soft and fruity. Solid but definitely less punchy than I anticipated. Juicy orange notes came through strongest. Good amount of sweetness. Peach and mango were also apparent. Hint of musty dankness as well. As the beer sat, the orange notes and the overall sweetness intensified. Later, the peach and mango really came forth. The flavor profile was super citrusy. Loads of juicy orange and tangerine on the front end. Fairly tangy. Subtle peach and mango notes were detectable in the center. Some pithy citrus rind appeared as the beer moved along the palate. Moderately bitter. White grapefruit came through as well. Big grapefruit rind and pine resin notes lingered after the swallow. Outstanding frothy, fluffy mouthfeel. The liquid contained a larger bubbled and fairly aggressive, yet surprisingly plush and soft, effervescence. Super creamy, slick and smooth on the palate. PseudoSue and its variants are all very enjoyable pale ales, but they fail to impress me like Toppling Goliath’s other hoppy offerings do. Like many of Tree House’s beers, they tend to be more “soft and juicy” than “punchy and robust.” Living in New England, maybe I am spoiled, or maybe the bar for what constitutes an amazing pale ale, IPA or double IPA has been raised to a level that makes many of the “old guard” stalwarts seem less impressive than they once did.\n",

      "ordered a Double Dry Hop Pseudo Sue from Tavour. Given its reputation and its scarcity in NY, expectations are high.  It pours an extremely hazy liquid that looks like freshly squeezed grapefruit juice. The carbonation is visible, as is a gentle and ruminating modest bubbly head that leaves lacing in its wake. In the nose there is initially an herbal, grassy and slightly dank quality. These aromas retain throughout albeit pushed a bit to the background as more fruity and juicy aromas take center stage. Hints of orange pulp, mango, and papaya fill the nose, as does a crackery malt backbone. As I put the glass to my lips it is soon apparent this will be something special. Smooth, juicy and dry all at the same time. Grapefruit pith, orange peel, hints of tropical fruit against a malt texture that evokes fullness and a touch of sweetness. Generously hopped in terms of bitterness, flavor and mouthfeel; earthy, piny, prickly, yet smooth and accessible. Slightly creamy with a medium body.  Tasty, complex and full of flavor.

      "Appearance: Murky yellow, big head. Smell: Citrus, dank, vegetal. Not as strong as I would think for a DDH beer. Taste: Balanced, bready and fruity. Moderate citrus. Very low bitterness. Overall: Picked up a bomber with bottled date 5/11, consumed on 5/14. I've heard that sometimes with DDH beers they need to sit for a week or two after bottling for best results. I suppose I should have done that with this beer because it was pretty underwhelming considering the massive amount of praise in other reviews. I would call it a well made pale ale but nothing spectacular.\n",

Undertones of herbal and tropical aromas, with notes of passionfruit, mango &amp; guava. Just a hint of malty sweetness to round it out T- juicy citrus hops follow the nose up front with a blast of orange pith, tangerine &amp; grapefruit zest. Mid-palate brings an tropical mix of melon, pineapple and passionfruit. As it nears the finish, resinous notes of pine and fresh cut grass bring it to a close with some earthy/herbal linger M- medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that continues into a slightly creamy, dry finish, super drinkable O- the base beer is already awesome, the double dry hopping just kicks it up a notch. Juicy and dank, but remaining super drinkable, one of the best pale ales I've had the pleasure of trying\n",

Smell- A nice blend of hops on the nose, though nothing particular is really coming to mind. Some noticeable pale malts, a bit cracker-y. Taste- Wow, pretty complex hop bill we got here, though its not to bitter. A bit citric at the start, some soft lemon, turning more and more grassy and a somewhat dank earthiness. Has a cracker like dryness towards the finish mixed with some pale malt sweetness. Mouthfeel- Medium body and carbonation. Smooth. Overall- A solid pale. Nothing makes this stand out from the pack, but there is certainly nothing wrong with it. A nice enjoyable thirst quencher.\n",

Picking up tropical fruits like mango, pineapple-coconut, orange, grapefruit, some sweet grass I'll say this, one of the best smelling beers I have tried.. Taste - Certainly not a light beer but it is lighter than i expected. Tropical hop flavors are there and there is a moderately high bitterness with the classic pine taste. Very drinkable, flavorful, not too much malt though. Not very carbonated which is nice. Very refreshing and not filling.

Very nice sweet fruity smell that I like on this one. Taste leaves a bit to be desired. A bit of that sweet, bitter pineapple fuit and some other bitter and that was it. Mouth is on the upper side of light. Just a bit of stickiness on the finish. Really fairly easy drinking. Not a bad pale ale. Especially at the price point. I got a four pack of stovepipe cans for 7.50 U.S. at a local Sprouts store.So I say it would be a good beer for when you want something more than the average Bud Miller Coors type of beer.However if you are looking for a real APA style look no further than Deschutes Mirror Pond!!\n",

Carbonation is moderately brisk, about 3.0-3.25 carbs or so. The nose is dank and catty with some pine and grapefruit. I would prefer tropical like papaya, guava, mango and pineapple, but this screams \"AMERICAN HOPS\" for those who love em. Mouthfeel is beautiful, crisp, clean, refreshing and light bodied. No off flavors, aromas. The taste is wonderful too. Catty, piney and dank with a beautifully balanced bitterness finishing slightly dry, enough to make you want more but with a little malt character to balance it out.

This smells like mild orangey and grapefruit citrus, light crackery malt, a snap of grassiness, and a little bit of pine. This one doesn't try to be a ton of things. What it does try to do- be a crisp, clean, and surprisingly flavorful session-ish beer- it does very well. There's a good bit of clean bitterness on the finish, with green grassiness, a little bit of pine, and not much of the signature Lagunitas dankness I'm used to in most of their beers. There's a crisp crackery malty thing going on, just enough to give this a nice backbone. There's a bit of orange rind and grapefruit rind, with just a little bit of citrusy flavor. This is quite clean, with a good crispness, and a very high level of drinkablity. As expected, this was really pleasant.\n",

Looks the part of a good American Pale Ale. Smell- Dank, floral, grassy hops, a bit of citrus as well. Not much in way of a malt backbone. A little bit of caramel sweetness and that's about it. Hop-forward nose. Flavour- True to the name, this is a hop-centric pale ale. Floral, dank hops dominate, supplemented by a little bit of citrus grapefruit. The pale malt backbone brings a bit of caramel and a musty graininess. Finish is a bit of citrus bitterness mixed in with some grassiness. Mouthfeel- Thinner bodied, on the verge of watery. But easy to drink, bitter enough but not overwhelmingly bitter that it gets in the way of my enjoyment as a \"just-got-home-from-work\" beer. Resinous, dank and appropriately dry.

Solid 2 minute head retention that regenerates with gentle swirling. Minimal lacing remains in the glass as I drink this.

The dank hoppiness from the nose follows through in the finish. M: Medium to medium-light...surpisingly light given the hop bomb nose and taste, it's totally appropriate for a 5.4% beer. An oily coating remans on the tongue and mouth commensurate with the lingering bitterness. O: If you're looking for monster Citra flavor (i.e., more hoppy than HF Edward) without too much punch or body, this beer is for you.

The taste is great - tons of floral, herbal and dank flavors from the hops which are mildly grassy in a good way with somewhat tropical and grapefruit-like in the juicy taste as if one were cut at the peak of ripeness.

Very hazy and almost completely opaque with a one finger foamy off-white head that slowly fades into a lasting ring. Sporadic chunks of soapy lacing left behind. Sweet citrus hop aroma with lots of citrus and tropical fruit notes. Hints of pineapple, lemon peel and grapefruit are accompanied by some dank earthy pine needle notes. Caramel malt presence in the nose as well with hints of biscuit and graham cracker. The hops smell uber fresh but the malt presence cuts this down a bit. It kind of smells like a tamer cousin of a WCIPA. Chewy full body for the style with lots of dank, fresh hop bitterness up front that lingers throughout over the sweet citrus/tropical fruit notes and malt backbone into a crisp, dry finish. Although the flavor is dominated by hops, the hop flavors are very well balanced. The palate starts off with very dry earthy piny bitterness which is quickly countered by an excellent sweet citrus flavor. Hints of mango and pineapple as well as some grapefruit and citrus peel. All of this is also nicely balanced by the caramel/graham cracker/biscuit malt backbone. A bit too malty compared to some other beers in the WCIPA style but still plenty hoppy and extremely quaffable. Recommended!\n",

      "Clear rose gold with three finger of bone color head. Rings of lace appear as the level drops. Smell is tropical fruit with a slight dank tinge. Bread crust malt. Taste is tropical fruit pine bread crust malts. Bitterness leads the taste. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation level. Finish is very dry and medium bitter. Overall bold APA that would kick old school IPAs to the curb. I enjoyed it very much. \"Ripper\" indeed!\n",

      "A 330ml can with a BB of Jan 2019 (canned April 2018). Brewed in Berlin. Purchased recently from Tesco. Described on the label as a San Diego-style pale ale, whatever that is. A: Poured into a tulip. A deep marmalade-amber hue with intense carbonation and plenty of floating sediment that looks like protein. Surprisingly dark for a pale ale. Produces a huge head of creamy white foam that lasts for a while before settling as a thick surface layer. Some lacing. S: Aroma of intense resinous hops with hints of pine, weed, vague citrus peel, mild tropical fruit, undertones of herbs/hay, caramel malt and ale yeast. Nice. T: Tastes of intensely aromatic hops with notes of pine resin, dank weed, mild citrus peel, herbs, grass/hay, mild tropical fruit, earthiness, caramel malt and ale yeast. Slightly sweet, followed by a robust hop-driven bitterness upon swallowing. M: Mouthfeel is smooth and tingly, with lively carbonation and good body. Somewhat astringent; dries the palate. Aftertaste of pine-laden hops, bitterness, mild fruity notes, caramel malt, earthiness and ale yeast. O: Pretty good, with a huge hop character that wallops your senses. Looks great, while the aroma and flavour are stuffed with resinous hops, caramel malt and ale yeast. Nice body. Drinkable, but the character is surprisingly dark and malty for a pale ale. Also, the hops veer towards the pine end of the spectrum, so the fruitiness doesn't come across all that well. Worth sampling, but probably needs to be ultra-fresh.\n",

      "Clear copper pour, creamy white head that subsides.  Nose is bready malts with a hint of grapefruit/ tropical fruit hops.  Taste is nice for me because the hops don't overpower like I'd expect such a beer to do these days. Due to the hops advertised on the can, I naturally expected IPA taste even though it's touted as a west coast pale ale.  I'm glad it's not juicy in a hopped-out passion-fruity way, but to me it's more subdued in the bitter hop department, and more juicy in an earthy fashion, with some pine, but also with (as other reviews will describe) an onion aspect to the flavor. The latter is not off-putting in my opinion; it provides a subdued dankness. It works in balancing out too much bitterness that could otherwise occur from the dry hopped ingredients.  It's creamy and medium smooth, and again ends balanced, with any lingering hop notes being tasty grapefruit.  I'd probably get this again, even as a post-lawn mowing beer to have.\n",

      "Treated as an APA, this was poured into a becher pint glass, the appearance was a semi-dark golden/bronzed color with a semi-thick messy sort of lacing. The aroma keeps a dry edgy danky sweet to bitter hoppiness rolling over some grassy tones. Malt level seems to be coming out to balance. The flavor sharply grasps bitter grassy hops to expend over the danky semi-sweet oniony hops. Balancing hoppy bitterness to sweetness in the aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation feels decent for what it is. Overall, not bad as an APA but not exactly \"juicy\" as Stone says. I don’t mind this for me.\n",

The taste of this ale is nearly perfect, good mix between the two different types of hops, reminiscent of Elysian space dust ipa but a bit lighter tasting.

      "Poured from a can into a pint glass. First time with this one; excited to try a \"San Diego Pale\"! Copper color, a little dark for a Pale, right? Fairly clear liquid. Sparkling white head with good retention; solid lacing. Looks nice.  Pine, resin, and some prickly, piquant citrus is first to the nose. Not a ton of \"juicy\" qualities, as the can suggests, but still quite pleasant. Slightly sweet toffee- a nice and I would say above-average malt presence acts in nice balance with the citrus. Little bit of dankness, and some orange pith. Nice orangey and grapefruit citrus are the first flavor impressions. There's some classic pine in the middle of the drink, along with a little more juicy orange, likely a product of the Galaxy, finishing up each sip. Some spice on the end and more grapefruit. As it warms, of course, the toffee and slightly sweeter orange do a little dance. Quite pleasant. Solid hop bitterness.  Medium-light body. Crisp and easy drinking, with a very nice dry finish that perfectly complements those prickly aromas. No booze warmth, but a nice tongue sensation with each sip due to the dryness.\n",

      "Hard to believe that I never reviewed this, given how many beers from Tired Hands I've had over the years both here at home and while in line at Other Half. This should have been a given and nearly a standard, since it has the most ratings of any of their offerings on here, but this came up a bit short for me when all was said and done. Some of it had to be due to it's age, as the bottom of the can read 5/17/17 with \"CANNED\" written underneath that, though that didn't seem to be the reason why this was a bit underwhelming to me... The pour to this was a muted goldenrod with a decent amount of haze to it. Tons of soft, spongy foam topped this off as there was plenty of lacing left behind as well. Much of that was along the top third of my pint glass but there were visible rings underneath that as well. Lots of melon, soft hops, and dewy forest in the nose as the taste contained all of those to the same extent. White wine, grape, light wood, dank forest, and some pine came through in the taste as this was quite outdoorsy, rustic, and reminiscent of fresh-cut grass. Lots of slickness here as this could have used a bit more carbonation to keep it from feeling too heavy. The malt was basic and the floral-like impression that this left on me wasn't quite what I expected when I cracked the can open... This felt quite stronger than it was the alcohol was light and this came across as a session beer, even if it didn't technically qualify as one. While not bad, this was underwhelming, odd, and not quite sure of what it wanted to be. Worth a go once to experience but this left me wanting more, or another beer at the least, once I finished it off.\n",

      "Poured from a 64 ounce growler into a 16 ounce chalice at 38F. Purchased at a bottle shop in 11103. Flaked oats. They vastly improve mouthfeel and color. Tired Hands seems to love using them, probably moreso than any other brewery out there. I really prefer the color and texture of flaked oats fermented in ale yeast. Hop Hands is fairly cloudy. Cloudy enough that I cannot see through the glass. And the coloring is light yellow, and kind of reminds me of Carton Boat, which has a similar ABV but a different hop blend. The look of this pale ale is really attractive to me, and I think that the coloring is by far it's best attribute. Nose is piney and fruity. Resinous and bready. Also slightly yeasty.  Taste wise Hop Hands is good. No it's not great, as you will find many better North East Style pale ale's with similar ABV%. Singlecut, Other Half, Carton, Kane all have better tasting offerings with a similar alcohol by volume gravity. The dank Simcoe flavors just don't meld well with the fruity ketones in the Centennial hops in my opinion. This growler that I got also has a sort of funky yeasty component to it, which may be because of a dirty tap line or perhaps a keg that has sat for too long. Maybe even a bad pour? But overall there are some slight off flavors. slightly buttery, slightly banana. Most likely from too many temperature changes stressing the yeast out. My growler and glasses were sanitized with starsan and then rinsed with cold tap water prior to filling and drinking, so these off flavors that I am getting are going to be the result of the bottle shop or the distributor.  Mouth feel is good. Not too harsh, but I can still taste some slight alcohol on the back of the throat. Oat Overdose is much more smooth with a higher %ABV, but this is close. The lacing and carbonation on this ale is kind sloppy compared to Oat Overdose as well. Perhaps this has to do with Other Half's excellent carbonation characteristics.  Very pleased to find an actual Tired Hands product in NYC. The drive to the Northern suburbs of Philadelphia is certainly out of the question, even from Monroe County. I would be pleased if they could maybe start getting some of their kegs and cans up as far north as The Lehigh Valley so that I may try more of their supposed world class offerings, hopefully with a fresher timestamp and less distributor handling. I absolutely love oat mashed ipa's and pale ale's, but I am just not a huge fan of the hop blend in this particular offering.\n",

S: Big grapefruit and pine usher in a stellar aroma profile with honeysuckle, lemon tartness, and pineapple. The malt is nondescript. T: I have got to start looking for the clone recipe for this beer -- it is so crisp and refreshing with upfront hoppiness with grapefruit, lemon, orange, floral, and pine without grassiness or dankness. The malt profile, while a supporting player, makes a huge difference in the enjoyment of this beer as it provides just the right kiss of sweetness and breadiness without seeming at all overly malty or cloying, letting the hops shine. The bitterness is low. A wonderful demi-session ale. M: Very slick and clean with low carbonation and a light body that lends a creamy soft quality and enhances drinkability even further.

      "Pours a hazy dark honey color with a frothy white head that recedes slowly to leave some sticky lacing behind. Aromas begin with some dank grapefuit, light pine, floral and lightly tropical hops. Some malt/honey sweetness soon joins in to counteract the greenery. Not the most potent dry-hopped beer I've come across but still quality. The tastes follow the nose with the slight honey-ed malt sweetness up front that is soon overtaken by the hop flavors. There is also a solid but not overwhelming bitterness from the hops as well which almost take this to an IPA level.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Finish is mainly dank citrus hops that linger ever-so-slightly. Overall this is a nice take on a dry-hopped pale ale but the bitterness seems a bit high and the dry-hopping comes across a little resiny which could be from prolonged exposure to the beer. While I like this I don't love it and would probably not revisit it again in a 6pack format.\n",

Slightly earthy floral hop aroma with grassy pine and dank resins countered by pale malt and sweet, zesty citrus. The blood orange stands out with zest and fleshy citrus fruit.

Dank and earthy with some grassy pine and bitter resins countered by a strong citrus/blood orange character.

This beer pours a murky, deep apricot amber hue, with two fingers of loosely foamy, and mostly bubbly off-white head, which leaves some nice melting frozen windshield lace around the glass as things steadily abate. It smells of musty, semi-sweet orange flesh, wet piney, grassy, and leafy hops, bready pale malt, and a bit of earthy yeast. The taste is more dank, musty orange rind, some now distinct hop-borne citrus, forest floor pine notes, dusty field grass, a muddled pithy flintiness, and pretty easy to under-appreciate grainy, and somewhat crackery pale malt. The carbonation is fairly tight, in a cutting frothy sort of manner, the body on the light side of medium weight, and mostly smooth, those edgy bubbles taking their proverbial pound of flesh. It finishes quite dry, the orange fruitiness more rind-oriented than ever, and the complementary citrus and pine hoppiness starting to erase any and all memories of malt (not a President's Choice trademark, yet). A fruit-forward, rather Indian (?) seeming Pale Ale, the overt hoppiness, and lack of any real balancing malt backbone much more reminiscent of the former implied style. At any rate, a pretty tasty affair for what it actually is, the blood orange-bolstered bitter PAC-NW hops keeping my interest on the level, 'til the very last drop.\n",

      "12oz bottle, a very cool new brewery arrival in Alberta. 'San Diego Session Ale' probably means what I think it means. This beer pours a clear, bright medium copper amber colour, with two fingers of puffy, loosely foamy, and well bubbly ecru head, which leaves a hanging band of dripping paint swath lace around the glass as it evenly subsides. It smells of pungent red grapefruit, orange, and sweet lemon citrus, bready, grainy pale malt, a touch of caramel, some hard water flinty notes, a twinge of musty, dank pine resin, and further leafy, weedy, and floral hops. The taste is more mixed domestic citrus bowl fruitiness, a growing tropical sideshow, gritty pale and crackery caramel malt, muddled pine and its forest floor friends, a waning chalky character, and some airy floral bitterness. The carbonation is fairly innocuous in its lightly-rendered frothiness, the body a so-so middleweight (which is way ahead of the curve for this off-shoot 'style'), with maybe a smidge of hop bitterness picking away at the otherwise standard smoothness. It finishes off-dry, a lingering graininess gamely parrying the still heady citrusy, piney, and floral hop contingent. Well, disparage a new style, and soon enough, the pretenders fall away, and the big (craft) boys get it right - despite this one's low ABV, the malt and hops bring their A-game, and prove that it is indeed possible to go big, while at least paying lip service to balancing the hops, for a truly sessionable IPA offering.\n",

Capped by a finger or so of weak head that surprisingly manages to persist. Lots of lacing on the glass. Smell is slightly dank, lots of pine and resin, with a solid citrusy backbone. Very perfumey. Pineapple, mango. But also a decent bit of malty backbone--some biscuit, bread. Slightly peppery. Taste is much the same. Initial dank, piney resin with a touch of citrus, and a surprising malt base from which it stems. Great balance after an initial bitter kick. Good body (especially for the ABV), and moderate carbonation. We're here, we're session IPAs. Get used to it. As good an entry into the crowded field as I've had the chance to try, this one could fool you--it's a much bigger, richer, more flavourful beer than its ABV would suggest. Definitely a standard-bearer for the session IPA substyle (with a very welcome sub-4.0 ABV).\n",

      "Pours a dark golden color, almost a light amber. The off-white head is huge and pillowy. The head slowly settles into a rocky cap. The aroma is strong on grapefruit rind and some pine. The beer smells dry if that makes any sense. The taste is more dank. Pine, onion and some tropical fruit notes seem to dominate. Some grapefruit rind. The malt is neutral but not as light as most session IPAs. Pretty amazing that this beer is 3.8%, seems beefier than that. Moderate feel with semi-soft carbonation. Bitter on the palate but not overly so. The finish is quite dry. A good session IPA. The hops are more dank and earthy than most session IPAs that I have had.\n",

Tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple and orange peel. The taste is very similar to the aroma, but a bit more subdued. Tangerine, grapefruit and some light dank hops. Slightly bready. Quite dry. Very drinkable with a light mouthfeel as expected. Overall, it's a solid Session IPA I would buy again. Not the best, but certainly one of the better ones.\n",

      "HILL FARMSTEAD WHAT IS ENLIGHTENMENT? 9/24/15 Acquired a 750 ml growlerful at the brewery last Saturday.  Poured into a Hill Farmstead stemmed tulip. Translucent orange with a finger and a half of white head which receded to thin surface foam and dense lacing. s: Moderate citrus. t: Follows the nose, leaning to a combination of orange and grapefruit. Biscuit malt is nicely balanced by a fairly strong hop bite which lingers somewhat. Dry finish. Later slight dankness along with light fruit notes bordering on Belgian yeast esters emerge. m: Medium, good body and carbonation tingle.  o: A fine refresher, good for thirst quenching or sipping.

      "Super huge thanks to TheLostGringo for a growler of this stuff... and it was only an extra. Shared with some good people. This one pours a golden-yellow; bright, vibrant, and translucent, but still plenty of unfiltered haze. The soapy, foamy white head settles quickly to a collar after building up to only about a half-inch in height. Good looking pale ale, no complaints so far. What Is Enlightenment is hopped with one of my personal favorites - Amarillo - and Simcoe, which is often hit or miss for me (and is usually only miss when it's the only hop used). Piney, citrusy, bursting full of oranges and some grapefruit with oily resins and a mildly dank character hiding in the background. Success! The pine comes through from the Simcoe and mixes well with the heavy fruit aromas from Amarillo. Malt? Nah, this is a hoppy pale ale, baby! A crisp little bitterness bites the tongue up front but it's pretty tame and never reaches a level where I'd say \"this is more bitter than a pale ale should be\". Lots of pines and leaves, followed up quickly with grapefruit peels, juicy orange centers, and a hint of lemon zest. Whatever the proportion of Simcoe to Amarillo is here, I don't know, but it's almost perfect. Such a crisp pale ale, relatively light bodied, yet robust enough to maintain its presence on your palate. Carbonated well, even for a growler (I guess that's why swing-tops are so good), so it keeps nipping softly at your tongue with each sip and finishes dry to keep you thirsty. A touch of yeast and malt coats the palate and only become noticeable once the hop assault has finally faded. I wasn't particularly impressed with the first two Hill Farmstead beers I ever had, but What is Enlightenment has essentially blown me away. Such a good pale ale, it's really a crime that this stuff is only available in Vermont. Though it was split six ways, I could easily smash through an entire growler of this on my own. So drinkable, so tasty, such an awesome pale ale.\n",

      "750ml growler shared by....wait for it...cbutova.  Pale hazy orange pour, white head, good retention. That Hill Farmstead look. For smell I wrote \"Uh, tangerine.\" More or less, true. Just fresh orange/citrus hops all up in there with danky pine, herbal and tropical notes for good measure.  Taste delivers what I can only describe as super fruity dankness. Just great orange, mango, grapefruit, dank earthy hops. Baked bread malts at just the right level. Hard to believe this a pale ale, just huge flavor and huge hops, but balanced. Medium-high carbonation and a well-bodied beer. Feels a bit bigger than the ABV would hint towards.  Very good, hard not to enjoy this one. I think this is the new generation of American pale ales. Enlightening.\n",

Smell is the best part of this beer. HUGE combo of resin-Y pine and grapefruit pith. I mean it is just gigantic and so fresh. Don't know how they do this. The flavor is packed with grapefruit citrus flavor, a little dankness. Some grainy cracker like malt. But this is a hop fest. The mouthfeel is a little thin but it is forgivable.

      "Thanks to Sean for sharing this one. Served in a Kuhnhenn goblet. A - Quick-dissolving white foam settles to some wispy patches, a thin collar, and splotches of lace. Murky peach flesh body. S - The hop intensity is crazy - I was shocked to discover this only contained Amarillo and Simcoe. The Amarillo is nostril-shredding, with lemon zest, herbs, and a hint of dankness, while the Simcoe provides a tropical undercurrent. I initially thought there might be Nelson in in here, but apparently I'm imagining things. Pleasant vanilla malt sweetness way in the background. T - Delicious mix of citrus, herbs, stone and tropical fruits, hint of sweet malts, and moderate finishing bitterness. No loss of intensity from the aroma. M - Zesty carbonation, medium-light body, lightly chewy, dry finish, and minimal alcohol presence. D - Crushable stuff. I think I like Hoppy Birthday a bit more but this is similarly excellent. I could easily polish off 2L on my own. Hope Shaun Hill makes this a regular offering instead of just an anniversary beer, as it's too goo to only be made once.\n",

The Citra hops are obvious in this pale ale's flavor. The aroma was somewhat more complex, but the flavor is clearly Citra. Very nice, long lasting citrus hop herbal bitterness in the finish.

Pretty legit! Smell: deep, dank, earthy hops; even oniony in their dankness. It still manages to be subtle, though, and not a total onion bomb — I dig it. Taste: herbal, earthy, dank, and a little citrusy — these hops don't mess around. There's a bit of sweetness in the malt as well, but it's not overdone considering the hop character. Bitterness is moderate; this is good stuff. Mouthfeel: medium body with a big carbonation and good creaminess for the style. Overall: I am really enjoying this.

The head recedes to a large central island leaving legs of lace on the glass. S- The nose is low moderate in intensity and consists of that weedy, almost catty dankness I associate with Citra. T- On the palate I get less dankness than the nose. Mixed with the dankness comes in some citrus early in the sip. Mid sip you start transitioning to a mild pithy bitterness which lingers. F-Mouthfeel overall is on the lighter side of medium. The lightness in mouthfeel combined with the light alcohol content make this beer quite sessionable. Carbonation is light which also adds to the drinkability. O- A good if unspectacular pale ale. Highly drinkable with enough flavor to satisfy on a hot day.

Sweet grasses and dank spice. Peppery hops. Drinks just like the nose and is accented by a light but lasting bitterness. Firm malty finish but abundant with hop flavors. That light tasting , juicy orange steals the show and the low abv keeps it going down easily. The bitterness is just enough to cleanse the palate and leave you with lemon, cracker and a tiny bit of white pepper. I'd say this brewer just winked at me with a pleasant and easy drinking beer that is a compliment to both Chinese and Indian food. Delicate and enjoyably sessionable.\n",

Pours slightly hazy deep golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, honey, toasted biscuit, light nutty/caramel, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness.

Light-moderate pine, citrus peel/rind, herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berry, citrus peel/rind, pepper, pine, honey, toasted biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Light-moderate increasing dryness from bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy/sticky, and fairly crisp/resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is fantastic. Zero warming alcohol for 5.5%. Overall this is a fantastic American pale ale! All around outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink with the modestly bitter/drying finish, never overly aggressive. Outstandingly vibrant, juicy, and dank Citra hop complexity; nice solid bready malt backbone, with minimal residual sweetness. A highly enjoyable offering, and spot on style example.

      "Nice little word play on the label. Wild hare. Hop to it. No age on the bottle, but after tasting it, I suspect it's a bit old. Slightly tarnished copper color, clear, bubbly, with sandy-tan head of good retention, very fluffy and lacy. Orange, raisin, herbal, resiny, peppery hop aromas. Also bread and caramel. It must be a little off/old, tastes more like a very dank IPA, minus the bitterness, but even then a little funky and sour. Not what I would call \"bad\" though. My shortcoming, so I'll kick in an extra 0.5 points on the taste (going on memory of prior tastings as well). Definite attractive light and dark fruitiness to it and spicy and vegetal hops, throughout, very metallic, with citrus rind and peppercorn in the back, but again little bitterness. Other than that, seems fairly malt-forward, biscuity or crackery with caramel. Feel is not too effervescent so I don't think it's that old. Medium-bodied, smooth, sudsy, quickly-flattens.\n",

Resinous, earthy aroma with subtle spice and grassy, earthy hop character countered by sweet malt notes. Malt sweetness is strong than expected in the nose with lots of caramel, toffee, biscuit and hazelnut. This takes away from the hops a bit but there's still a somewhat dank and oily hop presence.  Fuller bodied than expected with a crisp, dry and bitter hop presence up front that lingers over a sweet malt backbone into a sticky dry finish. Slightly floral but more dank and resinous with spicy grass, earthy pine needle and spruce tip flavor. This is countered by a sweet malt backbone with lots of caramel, toffee, dark fruit, bread and biscuit.

      "From: Binny's, Bloomingdale, IL Best by 07/06/2013 Glass: Standard US pint glass Two Brothers has a very good American Pale Ale with Sidekick, if not a slight bit \"2013 Generic American Pale Ale\" in its hop choice and flavor focus. A fairly solid balance of basic pale malt and fruity with bitter hops, I drank two of these beers during the writing of this review, almost without thinking. This is certainly a hop-forward, easy drinking pale ale that would be quite satisfying during warmer weather (or, really, anytime a sense of warm weather or tropical climes was desired). Pours a 2cm tall head of fluffy (medium and small-sized bubbles) foam, which has average retention of about one minute. Head recedes to a thick ring around the glass and a large island of wispy residuum atop the beer's body. Lacing is moderate: a few large random splashes of foam along the glass' perimeter, which are modified in shape with each sip. Body is a bright copper orange, mostly transparent, with mildly active carbonation. Light brings out yellow hues in the body, which blend with the faint orange to create a bright, inviting effect. Aroma is sweet, fruity, and somewhat floral, like a salad of slightly bitter orange citrus and grapefruit, with sweet tropical fruit (passion fruit, guava) marinating in a bath of two-row pale malt. It's not as strong, dank, and all-encompassing as, say, Zombie Dust, but it's surely looking in that direction. Flavor is of sweet tropical fruits (passion fruit, guava) with pale malt and enough bitterness to please a hop-desiring palate. Front of palate is of sweet two-row pale malt with unripe peach, guava, orange, and passion fruit flavors; hints of bitterness linger behind all. Mid-palate is of pleasantly bitter orange, grapefruit, these conflicting nicely with the sweetness from the malt and tropical fruit flavors (guava, passion fruit, hints towards pineapple). Back of palate features stronger hop bitterness alongside continued orange and grapefruit flavors; the sweet fruits and malts have been eclipsed by the bitter versions at this point. Aftertaste is of sweet, pale malts, mild lingering bitterness, and a blurred mix of oranges, grapefruit, and tropical fruit (guava, passion fruit) flavor. Beer is medium-light to light in body, with carbonation of medium-light intensity, just enough to softly foam the liquid across the palate. Perhaps a bit thin, though it could also be argued that this lightness renders the beer so effortlessly easy to drink. Closes dry, with moderate stickiness clinging to the palate.\n",

Pours a fairly dark amber body, dark for a pale ale, with a nice white head that slowly dissipates into a thick film on top. Looks good. Some lacing here and there, nothing special. Smells grapefruity balanced out by a biscuity and bready sweetness. Mostly grapefruits with a dab of pine. Kind of one dimensional.  Tastes grapefruity and dank, but a bit more biscuity and bready than I prefer. There isn't that juicy flavour that comes with Hill Farmstead pale ales or TG pseudoSue. This is closer to Zombie Dust than the others. This is kind of a fairly lesser executed Zombie Dust really. Medium bodied, resinous. A bit bitter on the back end with a bit of pine. No heat, pretty drinkable. Standard citra pale ale offering, comes nowhere near Zombie Dust or pseudoSue.

Notes of pineapple, dank tropical fruit, grapefruit, mango, light pine as well as some light grain and carmel. Smell is not very pungent like other citra beers, but still get light notes of all of these. Taste starts with grapefruit, various tropical fruits like papaya. The middle brings a light sweetness, as well as notes of grain. The finish continues the sweet grain notes, as well as more citra hop qualities: more grapefruit, papaya, and lemon. This grain quality is a little too strong and really interferes with the hop qualities that should be a little more pungent in flavor. Almost get a banana like taste in the finish, as well as a metallic flavor. Light body with a creamy and slick mouthfeel. This could be an older bottle, but I am not that impressed with this. The malt bill was a little too much and the citra hop qualities were a little toned down.\n",

Lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, mango, melon, gooseberry, citrus peel/rind, peppercorn, pine, honey, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/light earthy hops, and moderate bready malt flavors; with a fantastic malt/bitterness balance, and no lingering hop astringency after the finish. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with very smooth, moderately bready/grainy/sticky, and fairly crisp/resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is fantastic. Zero warming alcohol for 5.75%. Overall this is a fantastic single hopped American pale ale. All around outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/light earthy hops, and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth, and fairly crisp/refreshing to drink with the modestly bitter/resinous/drying finish, not overly aggressive. Perfectly balanced juicy, vibrant, dank, and fairly earthy Citra hop complexity; with a great bready pale malt backbone, and minimal residual sweetness from crisp resin drying. A highly enjoyable offering, and outstanding style example. One of my favorites.\n",

      "12oz bottle into a pint glass Bottled on 3/21/13 Thanks to Tee2Grn for this extra. A: Pours a translucent amber with 1.5 fingers width of white head which dissipates down at a moderate rate. Leaves a good amount of lacing.  S: Tropical fruits (mango and pineapple) along with some dank resinous notes. Tangerine and citrus rind. Really nice aroma.  T: Lots of sweetness on the tongue, sweet malts are the most prominent flavor. Not nearly the hop explosion that the nose was. There are subtle citrus notes and some mild bitterness. Not bad, but a pretty big disappointment compared to the nose.  M/D: Pretty smooth, carbonation on the lower end, a bit too low. A somewhat drying finish. Average drinkability.  O: Overall, a pretty good citra pale ale, but nothing that makes it stands out. Real nice nose but the hop profile doesnt shine through on the palate. Worth a drink but not something Id go out of my way to have again.\n",

      "Had this on 2018-03-17 in Columbia, PA from a 22oz bottle A - Mildly hazy golden-orange with a 3-finger pillowy-white head that sticks around with good lace.  S - Orange, pineapple, melon, cracker, floral. Barely dank. Smells really good.  T - Fresh pineapple, orange flesh and zest, bread crust, cantaloupe, pine, pepper, grass and herbal spice. Not dank at all; Moderate bitterness that lingers just a bit more than one would expect for an APA: Some lingering orange zest on the finish helps mitigate this. M - Medium body and carbonation. Moderately resinous and lightly prickly. Fairly dry finish. O - Top notch and different from their Pseudo Sue, which has more dankness and less pine and bitterness in the finish. Wish this too were available year round. Will seek this out again.\n",

Ooo damn, from first whiff I can already tell I'm going to love this! Spicy eucalyptus bark, green pine, kiwi and green papaya come in with orange and a faint hint of dankness following.

T: Hops - bready, earthy and dank! Tastes like Han and Chewbacca busted out some of the spice they were smuggling and used it as an adjunct while brewing an APA. F: Very solid mouthfeel for an APA.  O: I guess this is borderline an IPA for what I think of as ABV - but it's just an all-around great beer.

Lacing sticks the whole glass through.  Initial smell is sweet fruits--mango and orange--along with pine and just a bit of spicy earthiness. Slight onion and dankness as it warms. Taste is very unique, with the initial flavor being ripe honeydew melon. Don't think I've ever tasted anything like this before. Followed by a piney bitterness that's pleasing. Feel is medium and super drinkable.  Overall this is a really unique APA that has an IPA's worth of flavor. Really excellent.\n",

      "Drank from a 22 fl oz (1 pint 6 fl oz) bottle acquired in a trade with Oldskool47 10/08/15 Served in a pint glass The cloudy, yellow ochre liquid was capped by a creamy, bubbly, finger tall, eggshell colored crown that quickly fell to a thin ring. Small patches of drippy, blocky lacing coated the glass. The aroma was super hoppy and fragrant. Uber fruity and bright. Tropical fruit notes dominated. Loads of mango, passionfruit and guava. Really juicy and sweet. Quite dank as well. Stewed peaches came through strong. As the beer sat, the overripe papaya and guava notes intensified. Like the nose, the flavor profile was amazingly hoppy. Really juicy and fruity. Loads of orange and clementine notes. Peach and apricot also came through big time. Very tropical fruit forward. Mango and papaya were most apparent. Some overripe peaches appeared as well. Orange peel came through in the finish. Just a touch bitter. I definitely did not get those grassy and lemony notes that many reviewers commented on however. All in all, super flavorful and immensely drinkable. The mouthfeel was lighter bodied. Super soft and supple. The liquid contained a fine, subtle effervescence. Toppling Goliath's Light Speed may not be one of the brewery's highest rated hoppy beers, but it is certainly one of the most flavorful and crushable American pale ales I have ever come across. With a month and a half of age on my bottle, I can only image how amazing this must be super fresh. If you enjoy dank, juicy, fruity, Northeast-style hop-forward beers, you will definitely love this one too.\n",

      "Hard to read the bottling date but I think it says October 2015. Appearance: Somewhat hazy caramel color with about two fingers of off-white suds. Another TG brew with great lacing. Aroma: Straight hop essences of strong pine and spice with of dash of dank tropical fruits. Taste: If there's one thing I've come to expect from TG's IPAs it's clean malt flavor with minimal bitterness and a heavy helping of finishing hops. Light Speed is exactly that. It starts with a smooth pairing of light crystal malt flavor and clean bitterness with a nice concoction of earthy/piney/spicy hop character coming through in the finish to kick this one up to mach 4. More of the same in the aftertaste as the high point in hop flavor ebbs away. Although not unbelievable, the modest 5.8% ABV is a great achievement for such a hop-forward beer. Mouthfeel: Nearly medium in body with smooth carbonation and an overall sturdy feel. Good drinkability, which goes right along with the statement on the label. Final Thoughts: Just when the IPA scene started getting stale in MN (apart from Todd the Axeman, but that's rarely available in cans), TG starts distributing here and does not skirt us on the good stuff. Their ability to make a smooth and balanced beer with big hop flavor at a modest ABV is something to get excited about and might even be worth a pilgrimage to the mothership. Would I drink it again? Yes.\n",

The taste veers too close to the vegetal side for my liking - I feel like I am eating a dandelion stalk. Mouth feel is average with pretty decent carbonation. There is something about the 3 TG beers I've now reviewed that my palate disagrees with. I like earthy flavors but this beer is too damn vegetal tasting. Oh well, can't say I didn't give TG a fair shake.\n",

M - medium to light, crisp with a lingering finish O - love this beer. perfect for a hot day and so full of flavor. I only wish I'd have bought one more when I had the chance.

      "650ml bottle of the latest bottling of Light Speed, formerly known as Millennium Falcon. Poured into a gold TG chalice 7/21/2014. A- Slightly hazy burnt orange body with a one finger thick, foamy latte-like white head with spots of lacing here and there.  S- This smells phenomenal. Oranges, a bit of orange zest, grapefruit, lemons, mango, dank hop resins mixed in with a nice bread and caramel presence. Balanced somehow, yet the amount and quality of fruit and hop aromas is outstanding. F- The interesting complexities of the nose doesn't quite translate onto the palate where it's primarily an orange presence at the beginning which smoothly transitions to some grassiness and a sweet biscuit, caramel pale malt presence that ends with a resinous, mango-like hop kick. Very nice. M- Medium in body, soft and creamy whilst finishing with a nice dryness that I have come to expect of TG pale ales. Finish is a grassy mango combination that is better than it sounds. O- Nicely done TG pale ale, it's not pseudoSue but I really enjoyed the complexities in the nose of this beer, and enough of it comes across on the palate. Very nice stuff.\n",

Smell is where we get into it. You get tons and tons of citrus fruits, Oranges, Mango, Pinapple and grapefruit, but there is a real dankness to it to.  Same fruits as descibed above hit you the second it hits your lips. You can tell this is a pale and not a IPA, while there may be more hops then your average APA, it has the malt backbone to back it up and have it end clean and nice. Mouthfeel was, well I did not really notice anything about it, in my book that means it was perfect for a APA. Here is the deal, if you can get any TG beers on tap in your area then do it immediatley.\n",

Pours slightly hazy medium golden yellow color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and rocky off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, berry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, honey, toasted biscuit, light caramel, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and bready malt notes; with decent strength. Taste of big tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, berry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, honey, toasted biscuit, light caramel, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness.

Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready, fairly sticky, and slightly resinous balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.7%, Overall this is a delicious session IPA. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and bready malt flavors; very smooth and refreshing to drink with the mellowly bitter/drying finish. Very flavorful with an impressive malt body for the ABV from Victory malts; and I loved the Centennial, Zythos, Amarillo, Galaxy hop profile as expected. Juicy/light dank hops, balanced malts. Not overly bitter or malty either way. A very enjoyable offering and impressive style example.\n",

T - Danker than the aroma, pine, grass, toasted white bread with a light dab of lime marmalade, white pepper and a goodly amount of citrus zest bitterness. Finishes dry. The citrus-bitter aftertaste lingers briefly and then clears.  M - Light-medium body and medium-high carbonation. Crisp and a bit prickly. O - Very nice aroma with tons of flavor.

      "Dark orange/ amber in color. Poured from a bottle, decent head and continuous lacing. Get the piney, resinous aroma. Interesting taste. Expected something extremely 'piney' and for sure did get much of that but also had almost a ginger beer note to it. It's got some good bitterness for sure on the IPA side as opposed to only being a pale ale? The ABV pushes up pretty high. I would have guessed in the high 6 range and not the 8.5 that it is. A bit heavy on the carbonation but fairly thick mouth feel which again for me pushes it outside of the pale ale side.  Over all I like it. I tend to like the big piney, dank, resinous IPA's though.\n",

      "Pours a brilliant crystal clear orange, quite active. Head production is modest, even with a hard pour, and retention is OK. Smell is crisp and clean, with pale malt biscuit along with a touch of caramel malts, pine, and orange. Flavor meets the wickets for a classic APA: grainy malts, clean bitterness, and a hop profile featuring pine, a slightly dank resinous quality, and some citrus. The addition of orange peel enhances the natural hoppy flavors, and while it adds a slightly green flair to the experience, it doesn't overwhelm at all. In all likelihood, it would be impossible to tell the orange peel addition without being told. Crisp and clean feel and finish. Quite lively, with moderate carbonation sting. Just enough balance between body and easy drinkability. A very good beer all around. This wouldn't likely replace SNPA for me if I saw both on tap, but it's a solid beer.\n",

      "Fruit beer sure ain't what it used to be. While the brewers at Sierra Nevada flirt with this hop and that hop, they recognize that the flavors that those hops are immulating resembles citrus, herb and melon character. So why not amplify those natural hop flavors and aromas with actual additions of those fruits to exacerbate their character.  Bright gold and gleaming with bold effervescence, Sierra Nevada's Sidecar carries a creamy off white head that fuels a fruit forward scent of citrus, grass, pepper and herb. Its taste is crisp with a caramel and honey togetherness that intertwines like granola on the early palate. Its bold orange character trends from aroma toward taste as the caramels fade and the fruity hops begin to command the taste. Tangerine, red grapefruit, and kiwi all allow for a clean and varying taste that trails into long bitter taste with citrus oil and pine shavings close to heart.  Medium bodied throughout, the beer's dryness is firm but also restrained. Those sharp citrus flavors follow with a pleasantly dank, sharp and characterful taste.\n",

The brew is mostly clear, with some decent bubbles visible. The head is one finger of very-light-khaki foam that drops quickly. Some lacing left behind.  S-This is a pleasant smelling brew. I detect pine, spicy orange and tangerine from the hops, and light, toast from the malts. The nose is nicely balanced and slightly dank and earthy. T-The taste isn't as robust as the smell. The hops lose some of their citrus and pine complexity, and the malts are more doughy than toasty and sharp. The result is more bitter and grainy, and the flavors get sort-of muddled. M-The feel is medium to heavy for the style with a fine carbonation that lasts for a while on the palate. It is easily drinkable. O-The mediocre taste is a bit of a letdown after the nice smell.

      "12oz single bottle - not quite getting the name here - is it that you can actually hear this beer - oh, I see, it's brewed in collaboration with a heretofore unknown to me American sportscaster. This beer pours a clear, pale golden amber hue, with two fingers of puffy, caked, and somewhat bubbly off-white head, which leaves some streaky hovering island mass lace around the glass as it slowly recedes. It smells of bready, doughy pale malt, a lesser biscuity caramel sweetness, muddled kitchen table citrus notes, a mildly dank pine resin acerbity, some tame hard water flintiness, and further leafy, floral hops. The taste is grainy, bready pale malt, dry toffee biscuits, pithy grapefruit and orange, dead yeast, and mealy herbal, leafy hops. The carbonation is fairly low-key, and plain in its amateur frothiness, the body a so-so medium weight, and kind of clammy via a certain work-a-day smoothness. It finishes off-dry, the lingering pale and ethereal caramel malts having little truck with the bland west-coast aspirant hops. An easy enough to drink, but a bit harder to actually recommend APA, the lack of pep and/or verve not doing it or me any favours. If I had to make a last-second call on this one, in the spirit of the marketing, I'd have to say, take a knee and run out the clock, son.\n",

      "12oz Can $9.99 6-Pack Binny's Willowbrook Canned 5/20/15 Fist City is an apricot hued beauty with a touch of haze and carbonation that runs wild. Huge bursts of bubbles rush to the surface in waves keeping the microbubbled head alive and well. The foam sits at a sturdy cap through the remainder of the drink and leaves behind impressive lacing that eventually slides back into the body. She's pretty! The nose is chock full o' well integrated hoppy notes. Stone fruit is most prominent with apricot and peach rings shining through. Citra brings with it some of that overripe pineapple while tropical fruits linger in the background. Candied citrus peel runs softly throughout with a leathery earthiness as it warms. All that deliciousness rests over the top of a slightly sweet graininess and bready base. Impressive in its depth. The stone fruit is brighter yet in the flavor with vibrant apricot and sweet peach ring hoppiness. The ripe pineapple runs mid-palate while the tropical fruits merely whisper. Candied citrus peel add the sensation of an acidic bite on the finish with the leathery dankness rounding it all out. The malt profile is soft and slightly sweet making for a nice backbone with bready notes and a grainy finish. At 5.5% RevBrew managed to produce a wholly appropriate, plush, luxurious body on this pale. It's soft and velvety with a weight that hovers just below medium. The bitterness is just enough to let you know it's there, growing slightly as I drink. Drinkability is off the charts high with each drink leaving me wanting another. Excellent! Fist City is one of the better new beers I've had in recent memory. A great depth in the hop department while holding a superb balance with the softly sweet malt base. A beer to keep in hand as often as possible. Hopefully RevBrew keeps this guy in the rotation.\n",

M - fairly light and refreshing actually, has a nice feel with the carbonation, slight acidic tinge and overall it drinks well, the finish is a bit heavy with the hoppy bitterness. Nothing wrong with this, and I would have little issue with a few on a warm day. Just not an amazing pale ale, and lacks the extra push that would elevate it.\n",

      "In a can. Appearance: It is a light hazy golden color with a very thick and fluffy white head. The head stands on its own for a very long time and leaves great lacing. Aroma: It has a very fresh hop aroma. It is spicy and oddly has a scent of squash. It smells like bay leaves. Taste: It has a very unique flavor about it. It is a bit dank up front, then some of the spice comes to the front and it stays in the foreground for the rest of the drinking session. It has a very earthy bay leaf and spruce flavor to it. Mouthfeel: It's decent. It has pretty good bitterness and it finishes up dry enough but there is a chalky sensation in my mouth. Overall the mouthfeel is decent enough. Overall: It's a pretty good pale ale. It's not my favorite of flavor combinations but it's like having grilled chicken instead of BBQ chicken. You might want a different flavor but in the end if the chicken is cooked well it's still good. That's this beer. It's a good beer, but the spicy and earthy character of the hops might not be for everyone. I would recommend grabbing a can at least and trying it out.\n",

Flavor is bitter grapefruit, lemon - very \"rindy\" - spicy and earthy, sort of dirty and dank, with some cereal grain and yeast. Medium bodied and snappy. Very drinkable despite the not-necessarily-ideal blend of hops. Not what I was expecting, but interesting and worth a try.\n",

Smell: sweet malt and a rich, funky hop arome with citrus, earthiness and just the right amount of dank. I rather like it. Taste: pretty big malt base for a beer of this comparatively low ABV, with a nice, rich, oily hoppiness. Citrus and funk are big on the flavor, with a bit of dry herbal flavor toward the back. Bitterness is quite solid. I could drink plenty of this. Mouthfeel: medium body with a smooth texture and a decent carbonation. Less creamy than, say, rich and smooth, but overall I like it. Overall: I find myself liking this beer. It's not really hipster-y beyond the packaging, but I think it's a solid canned pale ale, especially if you like the funkier and danker varieties of pale ale.

      "BOD 11/4/15. Pours a clear gold with a bit of amber. Outstanding head volume, world class lacing and retention. Outstanding nose of grapefruit, passion fruit and a touch of lime over pale malt with a strong dose of grainy biscuit. Heavy light body that is smooth with a hint of oiliness. Superb carbonation level that is in balance with the body. The middle has a bit of effervescence and the finish is prickly. The flavor profile is quite outstanding and allows the Citra hop to shine. Intensity is appropriate for the style, as is bitterness. Balance is world class. It begins with grapefruit then flows into a moderate middle bitterness. Passion fruit emerges post middle bitterness over a fairly sweet base (cracker biscuit) with notes of caramel. Towards the finish, a lime influence emerges creating a nice contrast with passion fruit. The finish is a slow fade of slightly sweet zest and lime with a slight dryness coupled with an earthy dankness.\n",

      "22oz bottle. \"Extra Pale Ale\". Huh, tell me again why this isn't just called an IPA? This beer pours a clear, medium golden amber colour, with two fingers of puffy, foamy, and silken off-white head, which leaves some low-lying cloud cover lace around the glass as it gently subsides. It smells of dank pine resin, zippy red grapefruit and blood orange citrus rind, a prominent earthy flintiness, muddled, yet still exotic tropical fruit, crackery caramel malt, and some further leafy, weedy, and floral hop bitters. The taste is gritty, grainy pale and caramel malt, a less dank pine cone and needle astringency, sort of pithy mixed domestic citrus, waning wet stone path notes, an equally understated tropical fruitiness, and more leafy, herbal, and floral hoppiness. The bubbles are nicely rendered in their come-hither and fluffy frothiness, the body a so-so middleweight, and generally smooth, even the heady hops barely making a dent here. It finishes off-dry, the green hoppy acridity, the still good to go, but not particularly engaging fruitiness, and checked-out malt configuring themselves thusly. Like the few other examples of this 'augmented' style that I've come across, Knee Deep's version comes across as a merely thinned out IPA, the hops large and in charge, while the malt duly wavers. Maybe I'm just a proponent of balance (see Session IPAs for a treatise in the other direction), but fucking with the boundaries of a single ingredient isn't always what it's cracked up to be.\n",

The smell is very fruity tropical and mildly dank with herbal accents -lovely citra aroma. The feel is great with a mostly dry body with moderately bitter texture and low alcohol in the feel.  The taste is very good with nice tropical and tangy grapefruit with light herbal/spiced hop character and dry finish with lasting bitterness. The malt is very light and the hops are the main flavor with juicy quality with the aroma sending you back to the tropical and citrus in the taste with each sip. I love how there is simplicity yet this is a very drinkable ale. I have had other Citra single hop beers I did not think were done as well as this especially in the aroma which is why I gave this excellent rating - I recommend this to fans of Citra hops.\n",

Smell - Enticing aroma with loads of citrus backed by a bit of pine dank. Hints of caramel. Taste - A bit more mellow than the nose leads one to believe. Citrusy with a touch of pith and pine bitterness. Caramel malt undertone that plays hard to get. A faint stone pit nuttiness in the finish. Mouthfeel - Near medium in body with moderate carbonation. Silky smooth delivery, going down nicely with a refreshing finish. Overall - Delivers on the promise of a citrus forward brew, but not much complexity, though as a single hop not much was expected.

The appearance was a glossy to hazy burnt orange yielding a nice transparency about it and allowing a nice fast rising carbonation to fill a rocky foamy white head dissipating like it has all of the time in the world. Gently, rings of a slight foam stick to the glass nicely. The smell started off with a sweet yet danky onion growing into grassy-like and citrusy hops undercoating my nose nicely. The flavor follows the smell quite well allowing a slight dry citrus peel to empower my tastebuds to yield to a really nice sweet grassy aftertaste and finish. The mouthfeel is about a light to medium in body with a wonderful sessionable crisp sweet feel on my tongue. Bitter hops lay down the harshness hammer and it feels just right.

      "Really enjoyed the Over Easy and the Backseat Berner so I was eager to give this a try, knowing that this wouldn't be a true session beer or an IPA. At first, it came across as unassuming but as both the beer and my take on it warmed up, the dankness really shone through along with the harmonious blend of flavors, smooth mouthfeel, and ease of drinkability. This beer was indeed a Pale Ale in every sense of the style! Good pour to this, as the beer had a light amber hue, frothy head, and citrus pith aroma. Nice lacing left behind as the dankness came out as this warmed up. Prickly cactus, sharp floral hops, and grapefruit juice all combined to give this a strong presence from start to finish although this never came across as potent. The booze was just at the right level and there was enough oil and resin in the mouthfeel to serve as a reminder that this was a Pale Ale. No strong hop burn which kept this from being mistaken as an IPA. The pine and weed came in at the end but with so much going on here, it was harder to notice that than it would be most other beers. While not a session beer, I'd easily grab another if it wasn't after 5 in the morning here. It took a while to get accustomed to but like the newer offerings from Otter Creek, this was solid and proof that they've stepped up their game. Matched up well with anything from the West Cost and would be an excellent choice for a seasoned beer drinker looking for a go-to Pale Ale. A fun beer that's dead serious underneath it all.\n",

I don't recall ever seeing anything quite like this. The head is a creamy one with a yellow tint that reaches a height of one finger and shows good retention while leaving the top of the glass plastered with a thick ring and follows with an almost equally thick ring whenever it settles. The nose is resinous and dank and, yes, somewhat like cannabis. There's a bit of dry malt behind it, and it lets the hops come forward while framing nicely. The flavor shows the same dankness and resin while adding a woody and nearly herbal sort of dryness, definitely coming in with some leaf. The dry malts still hold it down and lay the foundation. This is a very nice, hop-forward pale ale that's well-rounded with lots of balance. The body is medium but leans light, and crispness is steady but not firm. It ends up, even as dryness moves on the tongue, to have an almost mineral quality that shows only in the feel.\n",

Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was like having fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice for breakfast! It begs the query of where an APA ends and an AIPA begins, but as a hophead, I do not necessarily care. Me likee hops. Me likee this beer. Finish was dry, but reasonable for the style. I am still trying to get my breath after last night's Wild Indica Cru Saison. My other next challenge will be to get the resins out of the carb, I mean, clean the sticky lacing out of the glass.\n",

      "I love the pale malts and the suspension of hop particles floating in the glass, Mike Gerhart’s done wonders in the Brewmaster series. Hop Mantra, Kind Ryed, Fresh Slice, now this Overgrown APA, and next month I heard Double Dose DIPA collab with Lawson’s is coming back to the Burgh!!! Back to this beer slightly hazed deep golden hue with a bright white head formed nicely, some lacing left on the sides of the glass. Aroma is popping with hops, citrus zest, with a deep mango tropical fruit note that’s just awesome. Even a touch of pear and papaya, deep herbal dank Mary Jane qualities arise in there two but the tropical fruit and citrus really shine and dominate. It’s honestly like candied hops, smells fan-fuckin’-tastic.  Flavor is great, the type of APA that if you tasted blind you would swear it was 1-2 percent alcohol higher and had the hopping rates of an IPA. It’s relatively tame in abv 5.5% abv and those 55 IBUs are seriously expressing some massive hop flavor and ample bitterness on the palate. Dank herbal bitterness, mild tropical fruit hop action a bit of pungent pine and resinous hop oils, this thing seriously has hop particles floating around.  Mouthfeel is a bit muddled, minor complaint the forced carbonation could be taken down a few notches…resinous hop oils lubricate things quite nicely. Way too easy to consume, it’s a great session APA for me I don’t care if it’s above 5%, it’s sessionable. Overall, I feel blessed to get these new beers coming out of Otter Creek Brewmaster Mike’s kickin’ ass and taking names and delivering hop bombs with integrity and drinkability…I bought the case last night stopped by a friend’s house and gave him four bottles. We probably drank about a sixer of the case. Came home polished the rest of the 12 pack off woke up today craving the beer, I think I’m going to need another case!!! I think it’s comparable to Hop Mantra that’s basically how it went with that beer. Troeg’s Hop Knife is coming out in PA very soon, another beer I’m excited to try!!!\n",

Rich, American hoppiness. Very citrus stressed. Soft, sweetness that provides a respectable balance. The hops are more dynamic. T-The brewery describes the flavor and aroma as dank and I find that description to be more apt here, in the flavor. It does have that rich, concentrated hop flavor that mirrors marijuana. I still think that the grapefruit is the most prominent flavor of all. Light grass and a bit of spicy hoppiness. The sweetness, like the nose doesn't give off very specific flavors but does provide a complement to the hops. M-Sessionable. Reasonably bitter but it doesn't feel like it's stripping your teeth. Right in between light and medium bodied. O-A tasty, hop forward beer that is probably going to find a home in my fridge a few times over the next could months.\n",

There is a slightly honey sweet aroma as well. Pretty dank with lots of hops, smells closer to an IPA. T: Flavors of citrus, orange and grapefruit mostly. Then some herbal spice, sweet malts, and lots of pine like hops. Has a lot of bitterness to it and is not as balanced as you would hope for a Pale Ale. Much like the nose suggests closer to an IPA. M: Light bodied, with a moderately high amount of carbonation. Slick and slightly oily. Has a lingering bitterness and finishes hop heavy.  O: Not a bad brew by any means but not anything special.

Certainly not the most impressive pale ale out there. Really hoppy aroma that is dank with some citrus hints. Some bready malt sneaks its way past the hop aromas. Definately West Coast inspired. Hops dominate the flavor. Hints of citrus, pine, and a deep dankness. Quite bitter and any sweetness from the malt hardly makes an impact. I feel the beer could use more carbonation to cut through the bitterness. It is chewy for a beer with this ABV. A trade off of sorts. Not as impressive as Indeed's great Midnight Ryder. The drinkability is just not here. Too bitter and one dimensional for my tastes. Definately for lovers of West Coast type of pale ales.\n",

Transparent golden body with a few stray bubbles making their way to the top. S - Aroma is pretty excellent, with a melange of tropical fruits, juicy citrus, dank, and a hint of onion. Nice sugary malt backdrop that balances but doesn't supersede the hoppy goodness. T - Taste is also pretty nice, with a mix of pine and zesty citrus, icing sugar malt, and a hint of tropical fruits. Bitterness is moderate and surprisingly intense for a pale ale, but it never gets fatiguing. Lots of flavor for only 5.4%. M - Carbonation is too high for my tastes, even after letting the beer settle for a bit. Super resinous and oily texture, medium body, and not as dry as I'd like. D - Aside from the middling feel, this stuff is great. I put down a 12oz can in record time, and I'm looking forward to working me way through the rest of the six-pack.

Some of that earthy fresh hop character continues and is welcome. Lots of flavor for only 5.4%.  Mouthfeel is dry and biting, with some sticky resin, smackingly delicious. Palates beware.  Yes!

All perfect. Smell is more sweet and bready like an English style ale and not citrusy or piney or dank at all like American varieties.  Taste is absolutely spectacular. Sweet and malty and bready like the nose with moderate hop bitterness in the finish. Very much on board with this pale ale. Feel is extremely thick and full bodied. Clocking in a 6% helps provide the creaminess and certainly not a \"hop water\" session IPA at all. So far the \"2.0\"series is striking gold with me.

      "Poured from bottle into a pint glass Appearance – The beer pours a nice slightly darker amber color with a one finger head of thick white foam. The head has a very good level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave tons of foamy lace on the sides and surface of the glass and brew respectively. Smell – The aroma of the brew is a mix of a bready, lightly fruited, and hoppy smells. The bready aromas contain some hints of a more doughty and roasted malt smell within. The lighter sweet fruit aromas are of a tangerine and orange nature while the hop, which are the strongest of the smells, are mainly of an earthy and herbal nature with some other smells of a grapefruit and floral note. Taste – The taste begins with a bready and more sweetened doughy flavor. The sweetness comes mostly from some fruity flavors of a tangerine, melon, and mango flavor with a little bit of a caramel sweetness mixed within. These sweeter flavors, with the bready tastes, create a base flavor for the brew remaining relatively constant through the taste. Right from the start there is also some flavors of hop, with an earthy flavor being the most pronounced upfront and with it remaining so throughout the taste. Other hop flavors do come to the taste buds later however, with some lighter grapefruit and floral flavors coming soon after the initial tastes. With a hint of a dank pine coming at the very end, one is left with a slightly resinous but still somewhat sweet and fruity flavor to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is on the thicker and creamier side for a brew of 5.9 % abv with a carbonation level that is on the average side. For the fruity and hopped flavors of the brew, the thicker body really soaked these flavors into the tongue allowing them to shine high and be heavily sensed. Overall – This was a lightly danker, but somewhat sweet brew overall. A very nice drinking brew and one to try if you get the chance.\n",

Head thins out and fades away relatively quickly. Thin little specks of lacing.  S: Nice sweet juicy tropical fruit. Caramel sweetness and tangerines...maybe apricot? Even some pineapple. Pretty nice. T: Oh yeah, more of the same. Juicy, juicy tropical fruits. Much like the aroma with the tangerine, apricot and pineapple. Get some spiciness too, an herbal spiciness. Like a moderate dankness I guess? Mild caramel malt and a light hit of bitterness in the finish. Lightly dank aftertaste with traces of tropical fruits still floating around. Mildly dry finish but not bone dry. M: Medium bodied, lightly oily and lightly dry finish. O: Damn, I wasn't expecting much from the reviews but this is delicious. It really captures the essence of what an APA should be. Hoppy but not a bitter bomb. Just enough hop character to give it some bold flavor but light enough to be easy drinking. There's been a big glut of \"session IPAs\" recently but this is exactly what I want for a sessionable beer. 5.9%, borderline IPA but so much easier drinking.

There's also some less-pronounced stone and tropical fruit--nectarine and pineapple seem to be the closest comparisons. Behind the fruit, there's a touch of earthiness and dankness there, and perhaps a bit of floral hops. T: Cracker malts at the front, followed by some bright citrus hop astringency that feels a bit more like lemon than the grapefruit/orange in the nose. A bit of floral hop flavor there and into the middle, as well. The middle brings on some of that earthiness of the bouquet, the citrus flavor intensifies and takes on more of a grapefruit quality, and the floral notes kick in even more. By mid-taste, this is definitely more floral than fruit-forward. Toward the back, I'm getting more of a dank/resinous hop flavor, though this is by no means overbearing. There is some subtle stone fruit and tropical fruit that's fleetingly felt. This one ends with a bit of bitter citrus rind, but, overall, it's a fairly clean finish. F: The mouthfeel is one of my favorite parts about this beer. It's on the heftier side of medium-bodied, but the carbonation and addition of oats make it very light and lively on the palate. Bright, slightly creamy, and crisp to close things out. O: I'm a fan of this new brew from Bell's. It's got great body for such a sessionable ale, very nice aroma, and a complexity to the hop flavor that makes it quite unique. I do wish it had a bit higher ABV, but this one is designed to be put away easily and repeatedly. If an engaging session pale ale is what you're after, I recommend giving this one a try.\n",

Not a lot to say about this one other than it is a great apa with no flavors lacking and nothing over the top. Well done.

      "12oz bottle. More outdoorsy themed pale ale from south of, I mean north of the, oh fuck it, west of the border Yankee sentiment. This beer pours a clear, medium bronzed amber colour, with one chubby finger of weakly puffy, tightly foamy, and somewhat chunky off-white head, which leaves some scratchy snow rime lace in parts around the glass as things lazily bleed off. It smells of a dank, somewhat musty pine tree bitterness, estery florals, grainy, crackery pale malt, muted citrus rind, and a mildly phenolic yeastiness. The taste is gritty, lightly doughy pale malt, a hint of untethered caramel sweetness, pithy orange and white grapefruit, and still heady floral, herbal, and pinecone hop bitters.  The bubbles are so-so in their capability to keep my tongue interested with their prancing frothiness, the body on the light side of middleweight, and sort of smooth, a wan clamminess (Imma lookin' at you, yeast!) sort of spoiling the party. It finishes off-dry, the limping malt still keeping a stiff upper lip, while the complex, if not particularly evolving hops continue to run amok. Yep, I'm not quite sure which hop(s) cause that musty, dank sensation here, but without the attendant big-ass caramel malt and sassy pine and citrus apologist bitterness, things fall flat oh so quickly. I know that there's no free lunch (a fallacy, so thank you, U.S. government reps in the park adjacent to Sandpoint's City Beach), and no free ride (a further existential quandary when considering the bottle in front of me), but I'm just not digging this one.\n",

      "Straight pour from a 12oz pry-off bottle to a tall Ommegang flute (same type of glass as the Capt. Lawrence stem); no freshness or bottling date evident, but this was purchased just a couple of days after Capt. Lawrence’s first-ever shipment to this distribution area arrived.  Appearance (4.25): Very nice looking beer—pours with almost three fingers of custard-colored foam that dies down slowly, leaving a thick, fluffy cap of rocky head as it recedes. The body is a rich, deep golden-amber color with reddish hues. Perfectly clear. There are fat, spotty suds all around the glass, merging into short, leggy swaths of lace all over the place.  Smell (4.0): Lots of that leafy, resinous, kind of dank hop character you get from Cascade and Columbus hops—citrusy, with some pineapple and grapefruit scents, but with a leafy, green character that almost smells weedy. There are some warm, moderately sweet notes underneath that come across like oatmeal cookies and caramel corn. Very nice aroma for the style.  Taste (4.0): First thing to come across is that green leafiness from the hops, which segues nicely into an herbal bitterness that sticks around for the duration, with some grapefruit rind bitterness and citrusy flavor (like candied lemon peel) bouncing around above it. The malt body is restrained, offering a grainy, bready body that’s easy to overlook underneath the hops. But it’s there, with a whole-grain toast kind of richness with a nutty finish. Very nice.  Mouthfeel (4.5): Great feel: just barely on the light- side of medium-bodied, with an active carbonation that tingles lightly and foams moderately on the way down. Mildly astringent hop oils dry out the finish, but not too much—this beer goes down very easily without challenging the drinker, like IPAs can. Finally, there was enough residual head left that you could feel a clump of foam passing your lips.  Overall (4.0): This is a very, very solid APA. To me, this is one of those things like the way you judge a restaurant by their soup: if they do the most basic and frequently overlooked part of their menu well, then you can tell they put a lot of effort into the whole thing. This is an example of that: Freshchester Pale Ale is very solid, thoroughly enjoyable, and it’s clear that even in this beer, the brewers paid attention to all the little things. Very nice beer.\n",

      "Appearance: Pours a semid-loudy, orange color with a moderate, crisp head that fades quickly. Aroma: Strong aromas of airy pineapple and cream. A little mango. Maybe peach. Some perfumey pine and flowers. Pillowy and not dank. Smells like a NEIPA. Flavor: Taste follows the nose with strong pineapple, grapefruit, and pine perfume. Little pale malt body A mild bitterness ensues. Feel: Lighter bodied. Crisp and well carbonated. Finishes very dry and crisp. Minimal to no sweetness. No detectable alcohol. Compared to Zombie Dust and PsuedoSue: This one has a lighter color. More clear. Much more pineapple and cream. Less bitter. Lighter bodied, but not that much lighter than Sue. It really drinks like an NEIPA craze in terms of flavor, without the milkshake malt cream mouthfeel.  Overall: Such a flavorful pale ale that is lighter-bodied and so drinkable. It mimicks so many NEIPAs I've tried. Flavors like a NEIPA, yet it is crisp, semi-soft, and light. Not creamy. I don't know if I could tell the difference between a $5 pint of a local double-dry hopped, oat NE-style IPA. This is a really drinkable pale ale and is showing the local breweries that Surly can match their flavors in a macro-style with half the ABV. Impressive.\n",

This was purchased at a Total Wine here in Florida when they got a special shipment from the folks at Surly, and the can was less than three weeks old at the time of consumption. Poured from a 16 oz. can into a J. Wakefield OG teku glass. A: Hazy gold – a gold that's a few shades darker than most APAs. Forms a finger's worth of white head with average retention, and a good amount of visible carbonation. S: Big tropical fruits and tangerine. Fresh cut pineapple, dank, and cracker malts. Milder grapefruit, piney and floral. A nice and big aroma for an APA. T: Tropical fruit and oranges, pineapple and dank. A light cracker malt sweetness. Lighter resinous oils and floral/herbal hops. A disappearing light bitterness in the hang, and some mild graininess on the exhale. There’s also a thin, metallic flavor in the hang of which I’m not a fan. M: A light body and low alcohol flavors. A good amount of carbonation sensation initially, but it disappears very quickly. The combination of these leads to a bit strange of a mouthfeel - it's a bit thin, even for an APA. O: A nice aroma and flavors, but the grainy and metallic flavors are enough that this wouldn’t be my go-to choice, even were it regularly available on shelves around here. The mouthfeel with the odd carbonation is a bit off-putting as well. You could do worse, but there are better options around.\n",

      "Pours a crystal clear golden straw yellow color with two finger of white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma jumps out of the glass of bright, vibrant Citra hops. Get grapefruit, tangerine, overly-ripe pineapple, mango, and very light pine. A touch of dankness as well. Outside of an extremely light honey sweetness, there is no malt detected. Taste can only be described as Citra hop water. This is not a knock on the beer though, as it is very light and refreshing. Grapefruit, pineapple, grass, slight dank, and pine are the notes that stand out from the hops. There's also some hints of tangerine and mango. There's a very light honey sweetness up front, but that is quickly washed away by a big drying towards the finish. Not much bitterness to speak of outside some slight pine resin and grapefruit pith on the finish. High light body. Quite carbonated, but also has some light creaminess. Very clean finish. I've heard mixed reviews on this one because it is so light; but for what it is, it is a great session beer. It shows off the Citra hop wonderfully. Although I feel with a little more malt and a little higher abv this could really be great, I'm not disappointed with the beer at all.\n",

This is not the Surly beer I've enjoyed the least, but it's certainly the most boring Surly beer I've had. Which I honestly consider a greater crime. Even some of the beers from Surly I haven't enjoyed (SurlyFest, Hell etc), I've appreciated for their willingness to challenge me. This is not challenging, it's just meh.

A hearty dose of carbonation with an average size head is light beige in color and turns to a slight milky layering after a few moments. S: Lightly tart lemon with a fresh burst of citrus/grapefruit that was fresh and wet and inviting. Some dank pungent flowery hops that can not be mistaken for anything other then columbus. Tart tropical scents are of very nice strength and remains fresh even after 5 months after canning. Dripping wet pine hops and toasted bread rounds things out.  T: Flavor of wet citrusy hops are juicy with some sweetened grapefruit. Toasted grains, lemony tart citrus with some backdrop of tropical fruit. good knockout of bright citrusy zing on the swallow.

A little - thematically - oiled baseball glove comes through the taste, too. But the taste is springy and herbal, with a grassy wildflower touch. The aftertaste lets some dank hops in too, and a luxury soapiness. For a heavily marketed beer, this has a lot of nuance. May 20th, 2015 - .392 is a regional beer landmark by now, but this was my tasting way back before it showed up in cans and at Costco. A lighter brown with a thinner head, it looks un assuming, but the aroma shows off a promising hop bill, and a slightly copper metallic scent. The flavor finds its excellence in balance, with a bit of soapiness, a hoppy ping and braised grapefruit. The body is lighter and refreshing and matches the flavor brilliantly.

Good thing it is a pretty great aroma profile! Citrus is up front, specifically zest of lemon, not a juicy smell, but more of a refreshing spritz of lemony goodness. Some grassy scents, fresh cut first run hay from early summer wafting over the fields. Taste: Similar to the nose. Big, crisp, biting hop flavor. Lemon zest and earthy dankness. Refined and biting on the tongue, doesn't linger and doesn't offend. This is a pale ale after all, can't go to overboard. Feel: Somewhat effervescent, light, bubbly, crisp and goes down easy. Overall: Worthy of its rating, sits at a bit higher class then the other XHOPS offerings from TG, rightly so being gold, the king of metals.

It is hop flavor centered and has pitch perfect balance. While quite complex, excellent flavor separation occurs. The sharper flavors arrive first (zest, orange) than mellow into pineapple and mango in the middle. The middle brings a very low level of bitterness that is rind based, but has a light spruce note as well. A slightly grainy biscuit sweetness occurs mid-palate allowing the sweet tropicals to shine.

Smells floral, dank, citrusy, grassy - holy shit does this have a great nose on it. Taste is just as complex as the nose with grass, pine, citrus and papaya and just enough bready malt to balance out all the hops. Smooth mouthfeel with perfect carb.

      "Pours a completely clouded amber-orange color with one finger white head, revealing a good amount of spongy bubbles. Tastes of a watermelon, biscuit malt blend, wrapped up by a herbal dankness. Orange and papaya both add to the watermelon, while enhancing the sweeter malt balance by introducing a lovely sweet ripeness. Hops produce a juicy lemon pulp quality, enriching the melon in a refreshing, truly enjoyable fashion.  Drinks very soft with a pleasant, well dosed, lively carbonation during the finish. Not yet smooth, which works well for the malts, lending a pleasant sweetness to the hops, not getting beyond a balancing purpose.  Brings a herbal bitterness to the palate from the very beginning, soothed by a wet grass dankness and white bread malts. After this initial hop punch, the taste fuses to a very harmonic flavor profile, featuring more and more exotic fruits among toffee sweet malts. The mouthfeel turns even softer after the beginning, smoothing the way for orange, papaya and crisp lemon, producing a fantastic juice quality among well accentuated malts. Finishes with sweet and refreshing watermelon among biscuits, together with a flowery dryness, accentuating the melon, revealing a fantastic flavor intensity.  Grat beer, exhibiting a unique hop composition, while integrating a subtle malt sweetness beautifully. Watermelon gets depiced in this awesomely well, with exotic fruits pushing it to the limit. A slightly biting, herbal note develops a challenging synergy with the fruits, accentuated by citrus peel.\n",

      "Picked this up when I was up at Tree House last September, as it was nice to finally see their brewery and order beer for myself there! Didn't know that this had a backstory behind it until I read it's description on here and had I not done that, I would have taken this as just another American Pale Ale. It was a bit better than that as the super-smooth aspect of it really came through as it warmed up, and I had to pace myself through my session to ensure that it lasted long enough for me to review! Typical Tree House pour to this as the liquid was hazy, orange, and juicy in appearance. Plenty of foam topped it off as it took a while to settle down, though that happened in big sections. Lots of tropical fruit, dank notes, garlic, and some pineapple in the muted nose. The taste was certainly smooth and juicy but just didn't quite make the cut for me. A bit too much garlic spice and pepper could be felt here as I had to slow myself down once this fully warmed up; but only to take that aspect in. With a light carbonation and basic, bready malt, the flavors came through even though the easygoing nature of this beer wasn't quite in line with them. Not a lot of booze here, which was the best part of this beer. Sure, it went down easily but I wanted something more juicy and flavorful. Tree House has lots of beers that fall in line with that description, but not this one. Canned 9/4 with \"F5 HOPNADO!\" written above it, this was not a hop bomb by any means and barely felt like an American Pale Ale to me. Worth a go once for something fun but those looking for Tree House's next must-have will be disappointed here...\n",

      "Very nice malt and hop bills, how am I not going to snag this one? I appreciate that this brewery often prints these details on the label. Pours a reddish amber color, maybe just on the orange side, with copious amounts of beige foam. Smells like fresh citrus, rock candy, and brown sugar. Some people find the hops underwhelming here, perhaps because the list evokes images of palate wrecking. Keep in mind that dry hopping increases aroma rather than bitterness, folks. I find the hops tasty enough, personally ... I get ample Centennial dank fermented citrus pulp, peach, pineapple, and papaya, along with blackberry and black tea. This latter flavor develops nicely as you sip, and a pine flavor also develops but does not reach epic proportions. Fine by me, this is not an IPA, although it does compare favorably with some of the so-called \"session IPAs\" I've tried. The malts are quite wonderful, with a little molasses, toasted crust, and the sweet elements from the aroma in decent balance with the hops, probably edging the latter out, truth be told. Body is on the light side, with a sparkling crisp finish that lingers with just enough tea-like bitterness to prevent this from being a true session option but who cares. Toasty yet tangy, fruity yet reasonably bitter ... Great brew all around.\n",

      "12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Bottle says 5.5% A: Pours a hazy dark copper color. The head is a two finger yellow shade. While it fades to one finger relatively rapidly, at that point the head retains itself quite well. S: There's a decent amount of piny, weed-like dankness juxtaposing touches of grapefruit. Malts definitely come through with prevalent caramel and toffee. Not my preferred style of pale ale, but definitely acceptable. T: At first, there are wisps of dank weed backing a sweet-ish malt backbone, while the finish is mostly mild, pleasant grapefruit. Bitterness is well restrained. It kind of lacks flavor, to be honest. But there's no one element that turns me away, either: it's fairly harmonious and balanced. M: This is where this brew succeeds. It's light-feeling, crisp, and goes down quite easy. The low carbonation actually works because the finish has a good dryness to it. O: Not overly interesting, but pleasant enough. I don't really see how it's a session ale at 5.5%. Not a bad beer, and not one I'd ever turn down; doubt I'd buy it for myself again, though.\n",

Pretty sure this thing is way old but with no date on the bottle I have no way of knowing. The upside is that there actually is a lot of flavor for a 5.2% ABV beer. Pretty moderate on the bitterness and balanced well. Mouthfeel: Medium in body with average carbonation and below average drinkability due to all the sediment. Final Thoughts: This beer is not He'Brew's finest hour. The hop character is too dank and muddled in with the flavor profile of the malt to really stand out the way it should. Would I drink it again?

Flavor starts off identifying itself to me as an amber with its sweetness and breadinesss, as well as something else (I want to say rye but I cant find anything to ID rye as being present so maybe something grainy), but than the earthiness comes in at the close to assert it APA qualities. Only slightly bitter and that bitterness introduces itself towards the end and into the finish. Nice silky, medium body to this. While this is by no means watered down there is a wateriness/crispness to this that enables its to ultimately drink more like an APA rather than a heavy, thick amber. Decent carbonation. My first beer from He'Brew and thought it was good. I enjoyed the amber/APA fusion I got from this though I wouldn't have minded a little more hop presence, as I did think the sweet maltiness was the stronger of the flavors. Perhaps my bottle wasn't as fresh as it could have been?\n",

The aromas are pretty dank and full of grapefruit and pine. There's a touch of caramel malts, but they basically take a backseat. Flavors are extremely sharp and crisp. Lots of grass and tastes like a fresh hop vine. Tons of pine resin and citrus. Very bitter and earthy. More grapefruit with some orange and lemon in the mix. It has a west-coast vibe to it. Moutheel is wonderful. It's light, but medium bodied. Active carbonation that makes it smooth and creamy. Very fun and easy to drink. This is an amazing beer. It definitely drinks more like an IPA.

S: Smells like a lager: notes of caramel malt and sweet corn are present on the nose. T: Thin flavor profile with caramel malts being the dominating flavor with earthy notes, leather and moss appearing in the background. The aftertaste is fairly bright with some maltiness drawing you back in, but overall the flavor is not what one would expect from a pale ale: virtually zero hop character. M: The mouthfeel is average at best. In the mouth it lack substance, and the swallow leaves you with a dank feeling in your mouth, like a basement. On a positive note, the feeling that is there in the mouth is bright and clean, but it's nothing powerful. D: The drinkability is high in this, as it has a fairly middle-of-the-road character, but enough flavor to entice you back for more. It's mostly bright and inviting, and not too sweet.\n",

The head has absurd retention, hanging around for days before settling into a foamy blanket. Leaves a nice ring of lacing along the way. The aroma brings notes of overripe mangoes, earthy dankness, and white grapes.  The flavor is very tropical with notes of peach and mango. Then comes a wave of dank, earthiness, not dissimilar to green onions. Finishes with some grapeskin and fresh pine needles. The feel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

      "12oz Can Big ol' thanks to Greezy Dave for this one! He's OK. Nelson is a juice looking beer. Not in that sense of those overly thick, viscous pieces of nonsense but in the sense of bright orange apricot and pineapple with a decent haze throughout. The foam is the purest of whites and easily forms a finger high on the pour. The head leaves behind sticky, coating, delicate sheet lacing. Well now, that beer smells pretty good. This guy manages to pull out the full spectrum of Nelson. There's a good sharp cheesiness off the bat that I always get from Nelson with a softly dank middle. Musty white grapes add to that dankness. A smattering of indistinguishable tropical fruits wraps it up, fruit salad like. A little green which in this case adds to the tropical character. The malt base is pretty nonexistent. That sharp Parmesan rind and middling dankness open this beer up in a big way. Both of which are bright, somehow. It a little chalky and dewey in the middle with that grape must picking up quite a bit. Ripe pineapple and underripe mango wrap it up. That green mango brings about some spicy character. For a single hopped beer this thing brings the depth and it's all vibrant. This guy sits a tick below moderate in weight with a fairly active effervescence. It's got a light feel and it's fairly crisp, to be honest. The finish is a little chalky with an immediate dryness. I can get behind that dryness. Nelson brings about a sturdy bitterness as well, which I can also get behind. This beer, it's drinkable as hell. Nelson is a winner from the Hill Farmstead bunch. It takes all the essence of Nelson and spreads it out to ensure total saturation. It's funky and tropical, sharp and bitter, delicious. I would drink this one often. Thanks again, Dave!\n",

Smells like pineapple, slight musty grape, earthy resin, a bit of dankness, and orange. This is a little bit maltier than I expected, which isn't a bad thing. It's a little sweet and bready, and on top of this is just layers of wonderful Nelson flavor- musty white grape, pineapple, mango, earthy sort of dank resin, weed, and orange peel. This doesn't finish quite as clean as I'd expect for a HF brew, but it's still very drinkable. It's a tiny bit sweet on the finish. This is another good example of HF's hop wizardry.

Taste follows the nose. Very bright. Citrusy. Little dank. Fantastic malt to balance the hops. Subtle hop bitterness at the end. As I've found with several HF IPAs, this one needs to warm just a bit out of the fridge for the real beauty to shine through. Mouthfeel is crisp. Refreshing. Perfect carb. Maybe the highlight of the brew. I know they're held on a pedestal and some think Shaun Hill and his brewery are overrated. Not for me.

Pours a huge fluffy soapy frothy 2 finger head that fades slowly with tons of frothy soapy lacing, hazy murky peach tangerine orange color. 4.75 Nose is all Nelson! Big fruit, tropical fruit more generic and not really citrus variety, papaya pineapple like, and a musty resin and dank earthy note, a little tangerine and rind later, fluffy airy malt base. Not very complex, just shows off the Nelson nicely. 4.5 Taste brings more fresh Nelson hop, with a bitter rind out front, quickly into genetic tropical fruit, again that pineapple papaya like, and a mild tangerine citrus. a light grapefruit like pith note but very light, quickly into mango and a big bitter rind, that turns a little spicy on the back end. Nice light fluffy malt base adds just enough to prop up the hops. Besides being spicy on the back end, the hops also bring a mild dank resin. Finish is drier with a mild fluffy malt, and big spicy rind hop and little tropical note lingering. 4.5 Mouth is med bod nice fluffy feel with great carbonation. 4.75 Overall great as expected, as usual for hill Farmstead, great hop profile, great fluffy make base too back it up, great carbonation esp for growler.

Aromatics lead off with peach fuzz, pears, dank weed, and tropical fruit. Floral and fruity but short of pungent. Light to medium bodied with a crisp, drying mouthfeel. Tropical fruit and hop resin starts the palate. Extremely light malt character, perhaps a bit biscuity and that's it. Low bitterness with plenty of peach, mango, and a hint of pine.

      "\"Michigan-grown hops are the story in this seasonal harvest ale. Hopivore is wet-hopped, with hops added to the brew just hours after harvest, creating rare, fresh flavors.\" Brewed in the style of an American Wet Hopped Harvest Ale. Available in 12 oz. bottled 4 packs and limited draft.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a New Holland tulip glass. Served above 47 degrees Fahrenheit. (Appearance) Pours a crisp foamy head of a pale caramel white color over a deep amber body with mild haziness and spritely carbonation. Retention is good and lacing is light and spotty. 4 (Smell) Peppery, herbal and musty hops with a moderate bitterness atop a biscuity and syrupy medium caramel backbone. Fairly unspectacular and difficult to discern this as a wet hopped ale apart from weaker or old dry hopped IPAs due to the mild and depreciated nature of the hop profile. Potency is moderate. 3.5 (Taste) More musty, peppery and dank hops with a mild bitterness atop a biscuity malt with a pinch of grain and caramel bread. Pleasingly reserved on the sweetness of the malt profile for an easy drinking and flavorful malt character, however the hop profile is unusually shallow for a harvest ale. 3.5 (Mouthfeel) Texture is slick, mildly chewy, faintly dry. Carbonation generates a subtle frothiness for a smooth, silky mouthfeel. Body is medium for the style, medium overall. Balance is evenly bitter and sweet. Alcohol presence is mild, no off characters. 3.5 (Overall) Surprisingly unimpressive harvest ale, especially not worth the inflated price tag when you can get superior harvest ales for a fraction of the price. 3.5 New Holland Brewing Company's Hopivore Michigan Wet-Hopped Harvest Ale 3.53/5.00\n",

S - Herbal and resinous hop oil, some pine and fruity hops. Nothing jumps out too much, but it's nice overall. Some sweet malts are present as well. T - The first thing I realized while drinking this was how watery it tasted. Hops flavors are pretty nice, skunky dank, some pine and citrus, all subdued. Caramel malts accompany in the middle. Vegetal hops to finish, which I don't think is uncommon for this style, but the vegetal aftertaste in this one isn't very pleasant. No alcohol, which is a plus, but this fresh hop ale isn't what I expected, considering the brewery and how cool it looked (I know I shouldn't get my hopes up based on how a beer looks). M - A bit watery with a light body. Some hop bitterness sits in the mouth. O - Not a bad beer, but probably not something I'd buy again.

There is a nice 1 inch off-white head that pops up and has some nice dense bubbles. Some sticky lacing can be seen clinging to the edges of the glass. Grassy and herbal. Citrus notes a plenty intermingled with some nice fresh biscuity malt. Nice bready undertones and some earthy grain are also perceived. Some slight dank pine. Taste-wise. Very impressive PA. Nice and refreshing citrus notes. Some tangerine and orange peel. Herbal and flowery with some nice pine resin in there as well. THis is well balanced by some bready and toasty malt notes. Very bready finish with some slight pale malt sweetness as well. Very delicious. This thing has been under my nose for a while now. Great crisp clean body with a nice bitter finish. Really good PA. Great flavors and well balanced. Up there with the best of them as a true APA.\n",

      "Poured from a 16 ounce can into a Shaker pint glass, \"bottled on\" date 6-1-17. APPEARANCE: pours a copper color with larger bits suspended about, two finger off-white head with excellent retention that slowly dissipated until a thin, unbroken layer of small bubbles remained, significant lacing on the glass, lighter carbonation. SMELL: bread, pineapple and a dank, earthy note. TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially sweet pineapple and bread then an earthy, metallic note on the finish. PALATE: lighter carbonation, medium body. OVERALL: this is a good beer but it could use more carbonation, it has an assertive hop profile that could pass for an IPA, I enjoyed this beer and would have it again no problem, would recommend to anyone who enjoys the style.\n",

Resiny finish, though not a ton of bitterness. Biscuit malt backbone. Medium light. Very drinkable. Better than most of the TG stuff coming out of Lakeland.\n",

Aroma of fresh tangerines, oranges, followed by a few dirty dank notes that turn herbal after a few moments, and a bit of spicy hop as well. Flavor is dank to start, then orange peel comes in like a tidal wave, grabbing bits of pith here and there, with overbaked biscuit and herbal notes on the finish. Slight overwhelming bitterness but nothing to complain too much about. Feel is exquisite. Totally polished, refreshing, resiny, and well-lit all at the same time. Nicely done.  Overall, Tsunami is not one to miss. Glad I had the opportunity to try this. TG never quits.\n",

Smell has aromas of peach, mango, orange, pine, caramel, with some dank herbal undertones. Aroma is quite pungent and vibrant.  Taste follows the nose with some peach, mango and orange initially quickly giving way to a piney bitterness, a strong caramel malt backbone and a strong dank herbal flavor. Pretty bitter with a lingering herbal bitter aftertaste.  Feel is a bit heavy for the an APA, but still drinkable. Feels closer to an IPA. Mild to medium carbonation. Although it had a nice aroma on it, this was a very average APA. Not the kind of standout beers I expect from Toppling Goliath. Too many other good beers out there to bother with this one.\n",

      "Bottled on 3/19/13. Printed very boldly and clearly on the neck, so kudos to them for that. I always appreciate knowing the freshness of the beer I'm drinking. Also, it's a twist off! Not that that means anything. Poured into a tasting glass. Grateful Pale Ale appears to have a pale gold body with decent clarity. The head is white and does an excellent job of leaving a trail of lacing all over the glass.  I can smell the hops from a mile away, and this beer is what? Five months old? Pretty amazed by this aroma. Notes of dank weed, pine sap, and bitter grapefruit all come to mind. Pretty dry underneath all that, so I'm not sure what to expect on the malt front. Appetizing hop aroma for sure though, and really fits the style profile. Taste wise, it is very much in line with the aroma. Nothing too strong, as the body is light and dry, and the malts are extremely light, so the hops are allowed to steal the show. However, the bitterness is moderate for a beer that leans so much on its hops for its character. The flavor is also of piney hops, and the finish is a wonderfully balanced, smooth and dry hoppy end to this beer.  Very refreshing, and quite a treat for the hop lover. A nice departure from what I feel is the norm for APA's, and I would definitely recommend this beer to anyone as a great, cheap option for a quick, delicious hop fix. Love this!\n",

      "Dated 5/9/18 on the bottom of the can, 12 days since it was brewed. Pours a hazy pale golden with a finger of rocky off-white head. Nose starts off with a kick of bright pink grapefruit and tangerine. After that I get lime, blueberry, orange zest, florals and a tiny hint of pepper. Taste follows the brightness of the nose, bringing in a bit of peach, pine and a crisp crackery malt. A delightful sparkling of carbonation across the tongue with the bitterness reinforces the brightness of this brew. A hint of dank earth at the end of the aftertaste. Thinner bodied than other Trillium brews I've had but I can tell there's still oats in here, allowing it be knocking on the door of a medium body. Medium- dryness and medium bitterness compared to their other brews. Just on the cusp between an East meet West IPA and a pale ale. After a selection of heavier NEIPAs, this is a delight!\n",

Bright aromas of melon, guava, orange, tangerine, pineapple, pink grapefruit, and light dank.  (A bit on the bitter side for most of Trillium's offerings, but it's still extremely good.) Pine and resins start, followed by grapefruit rind, red grapefruit, tangerine, orange peel, more pine/herb, and a really nice baked bread finish.  Feel is carbonated, resiny, and slightly juicy. Resiny finish with mild chalk and alcohol dryness.  Overall, not my favorite Trillium, but it's still fantastic. Good juicy notes among the waves of bitterness.\n",

One of the fullest bodied hoppy beer that I've had in this abv range. Crisp and refreshing.  Overall a stellar beer. This is the first Trillium beer I've had and I can see why they are so hyped.

      "Pours a briny, pulpy apple cider body with just a tiny, thin white head that fizzled quickly and provided zero lacing. Honestly doesn't look like beer at all, but I salivate at that juicy look so I'm probably grading it higher than it deserves.  Smell is juicy fruit salad (papaya, mango, pineapple, grapefruit, ripe berries, lemon, tangerine, and honeydew) sitting in a pile of fresh-cut hay and lemongrass, sprinkled in piney tree resin, located near a bakery making multi-grain baguettes. Very bright and dank, simultaneously.  Taste is a bit of a letdown relative to the smell, with bitter citrus rind, peppery cracker, dank pine, and green onion dominating and any form of fruit sweetness getting blown away. Very bitter and pithy and green. I'm still pounding it, and it fills the juice craving, but it would benefit from a little more sweetness for balance. Texture is silky and full (for an APA), a touch pulpy but not sticky. Just the right amount of carbonation.\n",

Musty grapefruit, stone fruit/guava, mango, and a bit of passion fruit and orange. A nice amount of bitterness against the oats, sweet grains, and slightly biting yeast.  The body has a nice amount of pilsner like crispness to it despite the soft, fluffy feel.  A great beer that is loaded with citra and/or mosaic hops.\n",

Very orangy hops with a supporting cast of mango, peach, papaya, pineapple, and just a hinting of pine needles. The finish and aftertaste is all oranges with a hint of dank green hop leaves.

Flavors are very juicy forward, heavy on orange and grapefruit, with a building acidity as you drink. Toasted grain backbone, with dried grass and peppery highlights, and a bolt of resinous, dank hops notes. Very well balanced and extremely drinkable, on a smooth, soft body that has a dry edge underneath. The aftertaste is more citrus, again balanced by the dank green notes.

Tall thick and foamy white head displaying good retention and falling to a medium belt around the glass. Tons of spotty webs. S- Somewhat reserved for Trillium but not in a bad way. Citrus and stone fruit hop equality and a dab of cereal pale barley for balance. Mango stands out with non bitter mandarin orange. Not a hop juice, more mellowed. T- Mango again the main standout note above blend of stone fruit, citrus, floral and dank herbal hops. Some apricot, weed and peach as well. Slight yeast bread but clean besides that and a hint of two row. MF- Light end body. Medium carbonation level and a frothy but not really creamy consistency. Slightly bitter in the ending.

It smells like Calvin Broadus and Wrigley's Juicy Fruit gum embarked on a world tour -- and this is a good thing, people. Behind all that dank, sticky icky explosion is a gentle wisp of Granny Smith apple belied by myriad grapefruit, orange and tangerine. Good lawd! Taste follows with a complimentary bitterness that is grasped marginally by a bready component. The feel is gentle; caressing me like Mariah Carey's lips in 1997.

A clear brownish-amber hue with low carbonation. Yields a large head of creamy white foam that lasts for a few minutes before subsiding to a surface layer. Nice lacing. Aroma of pine, subtle weed, peel, grass/hay, sweet caramel malt and earthy yeast. Hoppy and nicely balanced. Tastes of intense aromatic hops and sweet malt, with a spicy bitter finish. Notes of pine resin, dank weed, orange peel, mild grapefruit, citrus, grass/hay, white pepper, caramel, earthy yeast and stewed hops. Slightly sweet, followed by a resinous bitterness upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth and tingly, with mild carbonation and decent body. Hop oils stimulate the tongue. Somewhat astringent, accompanied by an aftertaste of pine resin, bitter aromatic hops and faint caramel. Good stuff - my only real complaint is that it isn't particularly pale. More like an American 'bitter'. Looks OK, colour notwithstanding. The aroma and flavour are distinctly hop-driven, with a subtle malt backbone to provide balance. Decent body; carbonation could be enhanced to add texture. While I don't find the style to be especially suited to winter, it is a deliciously drinkable brew. Worth a punt if you come across it.\n",

Taste -- Toasted malt, cane juice sweetness, white pepper, dank basement, faint citrus, pine resin. Finish is sweet with spicy hops and citrus peel. Weird.

I wouldn't say this winter offering from Ska has flavors that really gel with the season, but it is a nice little pale. Not bad at all.\n",

      "Echoing other reviews, this was a pleasant surprise, and a great deviation from the typical thin-bodied, watery session IPA. For all intents and purposes, this is a baby-version of Backseat Berner. Lots of citrus, with floral notes; a hint of dank earthiness. The appearance is nothing to write home about, but the body, like I said before, is not your typical session IPA. There's actually the resinous (not the oil slick feel that some breweries try to pass off as resin) feel to it, which is something I come to expect from great IPA's. I'm impressed.\n",

      "Mediocre appearance, really; light golden amber with very little head and just as little retention. Nothing about the appearance is unappealing, but nothing draws me in. Great hoppy aroma: citrus and pine, slightly herbal without being overpowering. Hop profile on the palate leans heavily toward dank hops, even more so than the juicy notes. Too unbalanced in that direction for my preference, in fact, although I am certain that there are many who prefer that profile. Excellent drinkability; crisp and light.\n",

      "Picked this up a few weeks ago at Top Hops in New York, having never had this before. I didn't realize it was a session beer until I saw how low the alcohol was but this certainly didn't taste or feel like one at all. There was more than enough body and flavor to this although no one would think for a second that this was close to being an IPA. This had a very nice pour to it, as golden hue, bright opaqueness, and moderately fluffy head combined for a nice and bright appearance. Not a lot of lacing left behind but there was a fair amount on the back side of my pint glass in the form of rings as I made my way through this. Dank citrus filled the air as I took a whiff of this, as grass, lemon zest, and pepper could be found underneath. All of those were in the taste as the moderate hop presence had a very earthy and biting tone to them, even though the bitterness and burning weren't enough to drown everything else out. All of that faded in the back as this slid down nicely and left a heavy pine/pineapple dankness that subtly faded away. How could this be a session beer? It didn't feel like one, it didn't taste like one, and it didn't have the hop profile of one either. I only bought one bottle but this was something I wanted to have again, even if it was a bit dry and needed a chaser of water to round it out. Regardless, this would make for a great summer brew when some flavor and body would be called for. Fun stuff that deserves a higher rating on here and a more wider presence at outdoor parties and barbecues during bright, sunny days!\n",

There is a little bit of cracker in there as well and just a hint of pepper in the background.  This is hands down the dankest American pale ale that I've tried. Big, bold hops assault the palate from the first sip. I know it doesn't sound appealing to read but the huge dank hop flavors of onion, garlic and socks are utterly delicious. Lighter notes of citrus come into play before a subtle wave of sweet, bready malts round things out. Zero alcohol flavor. There is considerably more dank hoppy goodness than I'm used to for a session beer.  Medium light feel with assertive carbonation. The body isn't big but it has significantly more heft than expected for its lower alcohol content. Nice lingering bitter aftertaste of dank hops and citrus peel.  I'm not typically a fan of the standard American pale ale but every now and then a shining star like Neshaminy Creek's J.A.W.N. comes along to beat my taste buds into submission.

From the CAN: \"If your beer is not madness, it's not beer\"; \"Dear Enjoyer, Hubert, If I didn't know you better, I might take you for an IPA, but after one sip, I knew you were a Pale Ale. With your sleek sophisticated approach to life and you general debonairness. You smell of hoppy pleasure and the balance you possess is stunning.

Color was a gorgeous Gold (SRM = 5), enticing The Gelt Gang of Midas, Croesus &amp; Mammon to stop in for a visit while the beer gave off loads of CO2 bubbles. Nose was very dank with notes of grapefruit, pine and CANteloupe as well. Mmm. Mouthfeel was a little on the thin side, not watery, but given all of those CO2 bubbles, I was expecting more. The taste was also much more mellow than the nose had led me to expect. The melon flavor(s) was/were prevalent, along with a honey-like sweetness, perhaps from the malt as well as a tea-like mellowness. Oh my! I was expecting yet another AIPA passing itself off as an APA, but such was not the case. This was definitely NOT an AIPA, so by extension &amp; default, their delineation would be fitting. Finish was dry but very mellow. The tea-like flavor gave it a sleep-inducing quality that was quite unexpected. Well done, Melvin. Thanks!\n",

The head has a great level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a good level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma of the brew is strongest of a pine and citrus hop mixed with some lighter smells of cracker and a bit of herb. Taste - The taste begins with a rather crisp and clean cracker malt taste that has a tiny bit of tropical fruit citrus and a decent showing of grapefruit hop. As the taste advances more hop of a pine and herbal nature start developing on the tongue, with these two flavors getting stronger then the citrus hop at the end. With a hint of grass and some light floral flavors joining in at the very end, one is left with a rather crisp and moderately hopped taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is thin and crisp with a carbonation level that is rather average.

      "6-pack purchased at Argonaut Liquor in Denver, CO earlier today. 12 fl oz can format with standard pull-tab top. Blue, white, and black label. 6% ABV. Pale ale. HEAD: White in colour. Occupies ~50% of my Sam Adams perfect pint glass with ~11cm of head. Frothy, soft in appearance, inviting. Retention is excellent - ~10+ minutes. BODY: A little cloudy, actually, but transparent and translucent. Pale copper colour of average vibrance. No yeast/lees are visible within. Appears well-carbonated. It's not a unique or special appearance for a pale ale, but it's generally inviting. AROMA: I believe the kids would refer to this as \"dank.\" Tropical, floral, grassy, fruity. Hits diverse hop aromatics, nailing everything except pine, juiciness, and resin. Tropical fruit dominates, evoking mango and maybe tangerine. Pale malt aromatics suggest the hop bitterness is well-balanced by malty sweetness, but I don't find any overly sweet caramalt or crystal malt aromatics. An inviting aroma of limited pungency that suggests a balanced and enjoyable yet straightforward pale ale. I'm looking forward to trying it. Aromatic intensity is above average. TASTE &amp; TEXTURE: Hoppy yet balanced, bringing tropical fruit: mango and tangerine, primarily. There're some floral hop flavours as well, but no pine, resin, juice, grapefruit, or overt citrus. Some scratchy bitterness does tag along with the hop flavours, and the mouthfeel gets too scratchy and coarse, dragging on the palate a bit and making the beer a little parching instead of refreshing. But it's aptly light to medium-bodied, boasts apt carbonation, and doesn't suffer from any harshness, astringency, booziness, oiliness, etc. Backbone is all pale malt. I don't find any overly sweet caramalt or crystal malts. Balance needs dialing in, but there's enough hop flavour here even if it wants for more depth of flavour and expressiveness/vividness. I do like it in a general sense, but the flavour profile isn't in clear focus, it doesn't amount to a gestalt whole of a beer, and the mouthfeel is troublesome. Not a juicy or refreshing pale ale, but rather an aggressive and challenging one that sacrifices drinkability in favour of hop bitterness. OVERALL: Far from a great expression of the style, but not a bad brew by any means - even if it's a bit too aggressive to be labelled \"pleasant\" or \"enjoyable.\" Indeed, it's rather unapproachable for a pale ale, coming off feeling like a beer that wanted to be an IPA but didn't want to commit. If the mouthfeel weren't as flawed as it is, this might be solid work; its hop build is interesting enough. But that dragging scratchiness is tough to get past, and as a result I wouldn't recommend this to others - even if I'll enjoy working through the sixer I bought in spite of the beer's obvious textural issues. Finally, it's worth saying what's obvious from the get-go - this is just too bitter for a pale ale. C (2.84) / AVERAGE *** 05.31.17 2nd impression: Low C+ / ABOVE AVERAGE\n",

      "12oz can - ok, so what does the 'M' in MPA stand for? Melvin? Madness? More? Inquiring minds would like to know. This beer pours a slightly hazy, bright medium golden yellow colour, with two fingers of puffy, loosely foamy, and somewhat fizzy off-white head, which leaves a bit of streaky and sudsy lace around the glass as it quickly blows off. It smells of dank pine resin, muddled tropical fruit (maybe some mango and generic melon standing out), bready caramel malt, and further leafy, herbal, and estery floral green hop bitters. The taste is gritty and grainy caramel malt, some blood orange, red grapefruit, and aged lemon citrus, further indistinct melon fruity notes, a mild stoney flintiness, and more piney, herbal, and spicy floral hoppiness. The carbonation is adequate in its supportive and sometimes palate-pinging frothiness, the body a solid middleweight, and mostly smooth, with a bit of hop acridity messing with a burgeoning creaminess. It finishes off-dry, all fruity this, and verdant hop bitter that, over top of a decent lingering malt. Overall, this is another bang-up job for this Wyoming brewing concern - they've created a very flavourful and hoppy pale ale, but one that keeps well away from (west coast, at least) IPA territory. Tasty, easy to put back, and I am getting tired of writing about it - I mean that as the highest compliment, in that I just want to get back to drinking it!\n",

Well balanced.  M: Very soft creamy mouthfeel. No real noticeable amount of alcohol present while drinking; very easy drinker. Beer has a nice fruity feel to it. Extremely smooth and easy to drink.  O: Probably my favorite Sue version I have had. The beer balances the fruity galaxy and earthy citra mix very well. Very smooth easy drinker that looks the part of a pale ale.\n",

      "Drank from a 22 fl oz (1 pint 6 fl oz) bottle purchased at Cambridge Wine &amp; Spirits, Cambridge, MA Bottled on 04/10/18 Served in a tulip Completely opaque, glowing yellowish-orange appearance. Much cloudier than the original PseudoSue I recently drank from a can. The turbid body was topped by a frothy, half-inch tall, bright white crown that fell to a thick, lasting collar. Odd shaped splotches of lacing stuck along the glass. The aroma was uber hoppy and fruity. Loads of citrus. Big freshly squeezed orange juice presence. Mango was also quite noticeable. Touch of honeydew melon. Bit of dank cannabis too. As the beer warmed, the cannabis notes really intensified. Skunky weed came to mind. Overall, really punchy and super smooth. The flavor profile was also very hoppy and fruit forward, but fairly bitter and slightly astringent as well. Grapefruit dominated. White grapefruit specifically. The Galaxy hops definitely made their presence known here. Tangy clementine and kumquat notes were also apparent. Subtle honeydew melon-like quality in the center. More grapefruit and grapefruit rind on the back end and in the finish. Super pithy and dry. Big, bitter, grapefruit rind and pine resin notes lingered after the swallow. With time, the bitterness mellowed out slightly. Medium-light bodied mouthfeel. Creamy, slick and smooth. The liquid contained a fine, moderate effervescence that frothed up nicely on the palate. Galaxy Dry Hopped PseudoSue is a punchy, fruit-forward and overall really interesting take on a New England-style pale ale. Like the original PseudoSue, however, this beer turned excessively pithy and bitter on the finish. With a bit more balance, this could be stellar.\n",

      "Got a growler. The taste/smell follow the other reviews for me. I got a lot of carbonation in mine. Turned to foam almost instantly when it hit my tongue.... notably “danker” than normal pseudo sue. Would like to try another bottle.\n",

      "Bottled 17 days ago.  L — Pours a hazy golden orange with a finger of dense white head produced with moderately aerated pour. Noticeably more hazy than regular PseudoSue, this looks more akin to Trillium’s Fort Point variants. Some retention and good lacing S — Has that characteristic Galaxy dankness. Pineapple, grapefruit, green onion, mango, papaya, and a hint of diesel meld nicely with a soft creamy yeastiness. Reminds me of In Perpetuity from Tree House  T — Beer takes a bit of an unexpected turn here. Starts with a woodsy kick followed by green onion and mild tropical fruits contributed by the Galaxy dry hop. Then the citra comes in with a burst of orange zest, strawberry, and grapefruit. Finishes with a moderate bitterness and astringency  F -- A bit thin and lacking in dimensionality. Medium- mouthfeel, medium carb. Still decent, though. A little less sweet than regular PseudoSue, which is good O -- This may be the first galaxy/citra pale I've had and I have to say it's a bit of an odd combo. Nevertheless it's a joy to drink. I feel like a broken record in my reviews of TG's bottled hoppy offerings, but once again the $12/bomber pricing just doesn't work. Probably the reason my local store in MA has their bombers sitting around for weeks, and that's after only two distributions to the state, ever!  85/100\n",

      "Hazy burnt yellow with a very large, fluffy uneven foam settling in fits and starts, leaving pockmarked rows of lace. Smell is very cannabic, dank and resinous--this is ultra cannabis--spritzed by orange and grapefruit, with hints of biscuity cracker. It gets less cannabic with time. Taste is tangy citrus with hints of Sweet Tarts, paired with less potent but still present dank cannabis, finishing with a biscuity swallow, and cracker in the aftertaste. It gets softer and more biscuity as it warms. Medium-light body, almost watery actually, but for a thin, crisp but weak fizz and a semi-dry finish.\n",

Reticent nose - with swirling some piney, dank, earth-like aromas appear with a bit of cracker. Palate is very dry with pine and earth. Don't get any tropical flavors that I was expecting. Feel is in line with what you'd expect from a pale - lighter with good carbonation. Pretty good DDH Sue version though I much prefer the Mosaic or Citra versions to this.\n",

Really well made and aromatic pale ale.\n",

A little too dank for me, to be honest-- the earthy musk doesn't really do it for me, but nonetheless, a beer that showcases the hop well and drinks like I would expect a TG APA to drink. A great beer, for sure! Recommended.\n",

      "Got in a trade with The-Adjunct-Hippie. 16 ounce can into pint glass, canned on 7/20/2017. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy deep golden/yellow color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a large cap that lasts the whole glass. Thick foamy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of tangerine, grapefruit, peach, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, berry, lemon zest, orange peel, light pepper/pine, honey, lightly toasted bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and moderate pale malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of big tangerine, grapefruit, peach, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, berry, lemon zest, orange peel, light pepper, pine, honey, lightly toasted bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate pine, citrus peel, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, peach, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, berry, lemon/orange peel, citrus rind, pepper, pine, honey, lightly toasted bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Light-moderate increasing dryness from bitterness. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, bready/grainy/sticky, and lightly resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.7%. Overall this is an excellent American pale ale! All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink with the modestly bitter/drying finish. Nice mix of vibrant/dank hop character; with a nice malt backbone and body for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.\n",

S: Kiwi, honeydew melon, juicy, tropical, lemon, hint of dankness, slightly floral. Doughy malt, light toast. T: Honeydew melon and kiwi up front. Lemon, earthy and dank flavors then take hold. Crackery and lightly toasty malt. Slight yeastiness. Bitterness is moderately stiff. Finishes quickly with some melon rind and dankness. M: Medium bodied. Full and creamy. Deep crispness thanks to the amole carbonation. O: Great pale ale. Mosaic and centennial are a brilliant combo- sort of old school and new. Very tasty, too easy to quaff back the 16oz can.

Medium high, fresh, spicy, herbal, oniony hop flavors up front followed by medium spicy hop bitterness through the middle. Spicy herbal hops follow to the end.

      "16oz pint at Olympic tavern Half acre tap takeover. Appearance: Opaque golden body with white head. lots of lacing left behind after each sip.  Smell: clean orange sweet citrus nose with light catty and dank hops. Fruity and floral. Hint of grass. Really nice hop profile in this pale ale. Hint of light bready malt. Taste: Much similar to the nose. Lots of sweet orange citrus notes and a hint of catty dankness. Light bitterness from the hops. Fruity and floral. A nice juicy quality from the hops that is reminiscent of top tier east coast hoppy beers.  Mouthfeel: On the lighter end of a medium bodied beer or the high end of a light beer. Which ever you think is more accurate. Moderate carbonation levels with a creamy carbonation noted. Feels juicy and wet while still being flavorful and sessionable. Overall: This is definitely my favorite beer from Half Acre; it is easily better than daisy cutter and double daisy cutter. Haven't seen this on the shelf before, but one thing is for sure that this would be a fantastic hot weather beer come summer time especially drinking it from a tallboy. Really nice combo of hops and the fact that it reminds me of east coast hoppy beers with that awesome juicy hoppyness character really put this over the top. This is a local gem!\n",

The nose is dank with hops - grassy, some light citrus, and a hint of savory (garlicy/chives) hops as well- but it's still a bit grainy and bready. The taste has a soft grain presence, grassy and savory hops, a bit of white tea that lingers on the palate, and minimal alcohol or yeast.This is a very light bodied, sessionable APA with a striking balance between hop potency and drinkability. If you've had hoppy MT joints in the past, you know what to expect, but if not, this highly drinkable and potently hoppy APA doesn't disappoint.\n",

Intriguing. Taste: the spice note comes through as something dank and funky in the taste. Some mild crackery malt. Not much else. Feel: light and generally unoffensive. Overall: this is a pretty simple beer, bordering on hop-water. The aroma and flavor are interesting (presumably courtesy of the experimental hop). On a side note, I'd love to see how this hop played in a saison—I think the spice character would complement the pepper/funk and produce magic.\n",

      "Pale yellow, hazy brew topped with a very fluffy snow-white head. Good retention and wide, thin fields of lacing. Lots of center-glass carbonation. Big hop aroma immediately upon uncapping. Bright, indistinguishably fruity hops; light dank sweetness, tobacco, and earth; honey; straw; light caramel and bready malts. Light but full-flavored, sweet, and incredibly dank on the mid- and back-end. Vague tropical fruits, honey, biscuit and bread, tobacco. Surprisingly medium bodied, not quite chewy, but still drinkable. No sting, not particularly lively, but not flat either. Easily the most full-bodied and flavorful \"session\"-level APA or IPA I've had. I'm not 100% on board with the hop profile, but it gives it a huge, interesting kick, and is well-worth seeking out, especially for fans of Mosaic and Citra hops (of which this beer is reminiscent).\n",
