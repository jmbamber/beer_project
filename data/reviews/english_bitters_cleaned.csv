Aroma is toasted malt, sugary caramel, yeast and a burnt hint with a thin hop character. Taste is malty toast with a hint of char, caramel, toffee, some chocolate, cream and yeast backed by a hoppy bitterness. Average at best, To tell the truth I'm a little disappointed based on what I have come to expect from this brewery. Taste more like a bitter Amber Ale than an English Bitter.",2019-01-04,1157,Honker's Ale
4.06,4.0,4.25,4.0,4.0,4.0,"It's funny that the best English Bitter that I had is made by an American brewery. As it has much morecontent, aromaand flavor than the English counterparts, I vote this the best I've ever had. Along with the typical/trademark English Bitter light/watery body, it has enough malts and most importantly, fragrant hops that stand out in the aroma. The taste is also quite well balanced, does not get too light nor too dry bitter so I found it overall nice - although not to an extent that I would want to drink it again. I loved the aroma though, it was a pleasant beer.",2018-12-17,1157,Honker's Ale

Living in England, I find it interesting that this is listed as an English bitter. I wouldn't have guessed that from just drinking it. It strikes me as more of an American amber...but whatever. There is just a light whiff of fruity hops, and actually the hops are reasonably pronounced in the flavor. Somewhat malty. Honestly, this beer sort of a forgettable in between beer. It reminds me of what small brew pubs used to make in the 90s when all they had was a light, amber, and dark beer to choose from. Just okay.",2018-07-02,1157,Honker's Ale

4.34,4.0,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Goose Island Beer Co. ""Honker's Ale"" 12 fl. oz. brown glass bottle, ""BOTTLED ON DATE: 01NOV17 08:47"" Notes via stream of consciousness: Honker's and I go way back to when I went to Siebel in Chicago and Goose Island was our unofficial pub. I certainly drank a lot of it back then, and then strangely I seem to have forgotten all about it. Well that's at least partially because that was 1995 and I couldn't get it back home. Anyway, it's poured a creamy finger-thick head of off-white for me atop a surprisingly hazy copper body. The aroma is brightly floral with some roses, fruity with apple and perhaps a hint of pear, and gently earthy and mineralish. It's very English in character, and I wonder why you don't see more beers like these lately. Moving on... the flavor follows the aroma as is usually the case, with some added lightly caramelish, grainy, and even honeyish malt and a bit of leafy and tea-like character from the hops. It's really nicely rounded with all of the components being clear enough that you can find them on their own, but also working with everything else to create a ""whole"". A median bitterness balances it (the label notes 30 IBUs) and it finishes mostly dry with some residual malt and plenty of floral, fruit, and softly mineralish notes lingering. The body is medium, and in keeping with the English character it's only softly carbonated giving it a smooth mouthfeel. Very nicely done. The only knock I have against it is that the head retention and lacing could be better but at the same time I'm not sure if the glass I'm using is actually ""beer clean"" so I'll have to give it a pass. Easily one of the best American brewed English-style bitters on the market.",2018-02-26,1157,Honker's Ale

I actually prefer to age it a bit. 2-3 years at a slowly up and down temperature level in my basement in a dead freezer.

3.89,4.25,4.0,4.0,3.25,3.75,"Bought on clearance at target (A six pack for 4 bucks!) Bottle date of aug 2015. Appearance: Nice amber color. Lacing isn't too serious but that's ok. Aroma: Hops hit the nose rather hard. Some malty-sweetness comes through but I mostly get hops. Taste: This is where I was pleasantly surprised. Malty sweetness hits the tongue, balanced out rather well with the bitterness of the hops. But not too bitter at 30 IBU's. Biscuity, caramel-y.  Mouthfeel: The maltiness is great when it's in your mouth, but leaves kind of dry for me. This is kind of a bummer because I enjoy the maltiness sticking around a bit. Moderate carbonation, obviously not too watery.  Overall: Better than expected. If it was on tap, I'd definitely give it a shot.

Not very aromatic, but you get malty tones and a little bit of citric, herbal hoppiness, caramel, and hints of diacetyl.  The taste is bitter upfront, but quickly the malty sweetness comes in to balance the flavor. Caramel, and a little bit herbal/spicy. The aftertaste holds a mix of both bitterness and sweetness.

S: Mild nose of slightly floral hops, mild bready yeastiness, faint touch of caramel. T: The epitome of balance. The malt is sweet and reminiscent of caramel and fresh bread. The hops come through to tie everything together and are floral and spicey. Maybe a bit of citrus as well. Fairly clean and ester profile is minimal. Pleasantly sweet. F: Carbonation seems to be on the lower end, which would be appropriate given that it's an English style. Body is creamy and moderately thick. It's not too filling, however. O: a really great session beer. While it's easy drinking, it still has enough complexity to keep me wanting to comeback for more.

First English Bitter ever, so here goes! Look: Copper color, smallish head.  Smell: Freshly baked light bread--like the kind you dip in soup. Malty, wheaty, tiniest bit of herbs. Someone on here said ""figs""--I believe you, but I'll have to train my nose for that one. Taste: Upfront is the malt and wheatiness from the nose. Very mild--the hops make a pretty casual appearance near the end. Feel: Low carbonation done right. To me, the mouthfeel pulls together the flavors very well.

O: I did not really want to like this beer because it's owned by AB but it's good, missing some hop notes but the bottle is six months old, it's very easy to drink, balanced, not popping with flavor, a middle of the road beer to me, doesn't impress but doesn't disappoint.",2015-12-18,1157,Honker's Ale

Rising bubbles are small in size and so scare in quantity, that I can easily count them as they rise. There is an abundance of tiny white particles floating around in the brew. Lacing is thin and very subtle. SMELL: Mild aromas of biscuits and caramel meet with subtle aromas of toasted malts, plums, figs, raisins, pale malts and earthy hops along with hints of bitter hops. TASTE: Mild biscuits and caramel flavors enter initially and are immediately followed by subtle bitter hop flavors. Mild flavors of toasted malts, plums, raisins, figs, and floral hops (didn't detect those in the smell) enter next. Earthy hops enter lastly as all previous flavors persist except for bitter hop flavors, which grow to mild. FEEL: Medium-bodied and highly carbonated. Goes down rough.

The taste then follows with complete contrast, having some bready tones, some whiskey notes, a few smokey flairs and complete absence of the original citrus scent. The feel is fairly smooth, but honestly I'm too caught off guard by the taste to really notice it, and if anything it is a bit too light in finishing for a bitter.

3.87,4.25,3.5,4.0,3.75,4.0,"Look: A classic, elegant look to this one: Clear, light copper with a medium, creamy off-white head leaving just a touch of lace.  Smell: Pale, yeasty malt with some light caramel notes are typical of the style, but not overly alluring. Some orchard fruits and spicy Saaz-like hops seem out of place, but aren't off-putting.  Taste: A rich, round combination of toasted caramel and grainy malt is thoroughly enjoyable on its own, but a medium serving of spicy hops brings balancing mild bitterness and even more interest. For a session beer, this is certainly a complex flavor profile, but the aftertaste remains smooth and clean.  Mouthfeel: Strong carbonation adds to a dry finish, and while this creates a crisp, refreshing quality, it's not typical of the English Bitter style, and distracts somewhat from the maltiness. The medium body, however, is able to support the diverse flavors.  Overall: With some minor exceptions, this is a pretty good example of an English Bitter, particularly when it comes to the complexity of the malt. More importantly, great taste combined with great drinkability makes this a definite crowd pleaser.",2015-10-17,1157,Honker's Ale
4.12,4.25,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.25,"I remember trying this beer for the first time – it was my first introduction into craft beer. I had no idea what I was getting into, and thought it was grotesque because it was so bitter. 7 years later I revisit this beer.  Appearance : Pours a honey cider colored body, 60% opaque. The head is creamy and large, measuring about 3 fingers, and leaving generous lace as it recedes down the glass. (4.25) Aroma : Lots of biscuit malts, a dash of honey, and quite a bit of caramel sweetness. The hop aroma is actually pretty faint in this one, which is okay by me, but is piney in nature. There are some melon rinds and juicy tropical notes as well. Mostly caramel and honey and biscuit sweetness going on here. (4) Taste : For a bitter this isn’t overpowering or offensive. The malts are very prominent here, yielding caramel, cracker, biscuit, and toasted grain. A pleasant hop bitterness shoves the malt forward, eventually making an appearance on the back end. (4) Feel : The feel is divine. Rich and creamy, smooth, pleasantly carbonated, and easy to drink. It dries on the palate and invites another gulp. (4.5) Overall : It’s hard to fault Goose Island’s Honker’s Ale for anything really. It’s a great bitter and has a fabulous malt backbone to compliment the resinous hop. I think it’s the best ESB I’ve had yet. (4.25)",2015-10-15,1157,Honker's Ale

SMELL: there is not much going on here, faint caramel and bread. TASTE: the taste follows the nose, this is a malt forward beer, initially sweet caramel then some bread and a mild metallic hop profile. PALATE: medium body, medium carbonation. OVERALL: this is an inoffensive but unspectacular beer, it's in the shallow end of the pool for craft beer, a safe beer to serve to guests, would have a basic appeal to anyone who likes beer but I would not seek this one out.

3.9,4.25,4.75,3.5,3.0,4.0,"The aroma is the classic British hop smell that sets up anticipation of a fine UK bitter. It is not the dominant hop fragrance us Americans push forward in our ales. Instead, it is subtle by comparison. So, when you drink this, sit up straight, mind your manners, and speak in full sentences using proper grammar. The color is almost copper in color and sets an expectation of maltiness, but like the hops, this too is subtle -- almost too subtle, to the point that I thought it was missing from the beer.  Similarly, the ""feel"" of the beer dissipates quickly and leaves you with a slight echo of resin from the hops. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised a Chicago microbrewery could pull off a British bitter this nice. Good night for now, and may all your beers be fantastic.",2015-09-02,1157,Honker's Ale

Smell: Given the bitter nose, it is watered down coffee and some herbs. Taste: The palate is more interesting than the nose. The brief sweetness on the front-end is akin to that of honey. Then, it shifts quickly to notes of coffee along with nuts and finishes with a bitter grassy taste. Feel: The beer had a creamy feeling in that a few liquid stays in your mouth. Moreover, despite the low ABV, this beer dries your mouth, which is not a bad thing. Overall: It's an enjoyable session beer given its light bitterness. The latter is not aggressive, but just bitter and tasty enough. The best part was the grassy notes on the end, which made it stood out from the light beers my friends and I had at a bar.",2015-08-29,1157,Honker's Ale
3.83,4.0,4.0,3.75,3.75,3.75,"From a single into a Spieglau IPA glass, Pours a very slightly hazy light copper, and about one inch of puffy, off-white head, that sticks around a bit. Fairly good lacing. Nose is very promising -- bready and biscuity, some toast, some sweet toffee and some light floral/earthy hops. Actually, the toffee is a little dominant, and there is some kind of fruity sweetness that pairs...maybe dates and oranges, or something jammy and a little rich.  Tasting, this isn't quite as lovely as the nose, but still nice: front is easy and inviting, with biscuit, bread and toffee, then a little gentle leafy floral hoppiness, and a little sweet orange and sweet nuttiness too. Finishes with the toffee still lingering and some very faint prickly citric hops, that provide a nice gentle easy-going bitterness. Mouthful: very nice body (esp considering the abv), low carbonation, kind of sits on the tongue a bit flatly...dry at the end. I don't get a chance to drink enough bitters these days, so it is hard to honestly consider how this stacks up...it's a little too toffee-sweet to be ideal for me, and it doesn't have as much of the fruit and nutty notes that I like best in the style; still, I quite enjoyed it, and it makes for a nice change of pace. Takes me back to Chicago days long ago! Final Grade: 3.8, a solid B+. Honkers Ale is not a bad little bitter; not at all. This is a nicely-crafted session ale that is flavourful and balanced, making it an excellent gateway craft beer.

3.8,4.25,3.5,3.75,4.0,4.0,"341 mL bottle from a 12-pack picked up at The Beer Store; bottled Jun 9 2015 and served slightly chilled. This is now being brewed and bottled by Labatt in Montreal for the eastern Canadian market.  Pours a hazy, reddish copper-amber colour, replete with streams of effervescent bubbles streaming to the surface, whereupon they reinforce the one inch of puffy, frothy, off-white coloured head that is situated there. Excellent retention; it fades slowly, leaving behind gobs of lace as it is reduced to a lumpy, foamy cap and collar. This is a beautiful-looking beer. On the nose, I am getting notes of bready wheat, toasted biscuit, sponge toffee and a few whiffs of grassy, floral hops. Lightly fruity, too, with suggestions of plum or apricot. This is a well-balanced English-style ale that is fairly straightforward in construction, but remains wonderfully drinkable. The malt-dominant first half of the profile features biscuity, bready malts and toffee sweetness with just a hint of nutty flavour. Candied orange provides a segue into the more hop-forward finish - leafy and grassy; the hops impart an earthy, restrained bitterness that hangs on into the aftertaste, along with a touch of wheaty malt sweetness. Light-bodied, with subtle carbonation that barely agitates the palate, producing a soft, smooth mouthfeel. This one drinks like a dream... if I were camping, 12 of these over the course of an evening would be within the realm of possibility.  Final Grade: 3.8, a solid B+. Honkers Ale is not a bad little bitter; not at all. This is a nicely-crafted session ale that is flavourful and balanced, making it an excellent gateway craft beer.

Beery. Taste: Dry arrival, dry caramelly middle with no sweetness. Bitter, clean finish. This is shockingly like Sixpoint Sweet Action (Cream Ale) and MadTree Happy Amber, though less medicinal than either and with slightly more of the typically English estery-ness.  Mouthfeel: Light, crisp, clean. Lots of carbonation for an ale.  Overall: Pretty much a perfect English-style bitter, tough overcarbonated. Less lingering bitterness than Happy Amber or Sweet Action.

A ruby reddish bronze with a finger of low key light beige frothy head. Aroma is citric fruit and gooseberry, Granny Smith apple, lightly toasted sweet bread. Palate is a buttery, nutty malt backbone coupled with acerbically tart gooseberries, under-ripe apples and pears, iron supplement, biscuits, a hint of lemon-lime citrus. Rather uniform, straightforward. Not particularly complex but bright and assertive. Thin bodied and moderately carbonated, with a hoppy finish. The latter becomes more powerful over the course of a pint, the hops gaining salience to provide some needed earthy ""forest floor"" English flavor. A toffee sweetness also emerges late. Well-executed bitter. The tartness perhaps masks some of the underlying flavors that would make this less of a palate fatigue problem over the course of a long session.",2015-01-31,1157,Honker's Ale

T - A quick flash of orange spice upfront mellows out into earthy English-style malts. The finish has is a good balance of dryness, caramel sweetness, and herbal bitterness. T - The low ABV gives the beer a slightly slick, oily mouthfeel. The carbonation is decent, though. A - A very good session beer. Could have been great were it not for the weird oiliness of the body.

Little or no lacing. Fantastic colouration if you hold it up to the light. Smell: Hops and ... something else. Can't quite put my finger (or nose) on it, but there's definitely something else there - reminds me a bit of citrusy furniture polish. Not unpleasant. Taste: Not nearly as hoppy as it smells - there's hops and malt there with some lingering fruitiness. Either way, it doesn't last long and leaves a fairly bitter, hoppy finish. Nothing particularly earth-shattering although I've had much, much worse. Feel: Not a particularly heavy beer by any means - small amount of carbonation but otherwise eminently drinkable. Overall: Goose Island seems to get a lot of love in these pages, as well as from some of my Chicago-based co-workers.

Retention is pretty good, but the texture of the head is even nicer (very whipped cream-like). Thick rings of lacing are left on the sides of the glass. (4) Smell: It starts off with plenty of sweet caramel malts, and letting it warm up will reveal a touch of hopping. There isn't much else to the nose, but it smells a bit richer than its ABV might suggest. (3.25) Taste: First, I pick up some of the earthy hops coming through, while the mid-taste and back end feature cracker-like maltiness. A touch of sweetness builds up on the palate, too. It's quite simplistic at the end of the day, but it's still hitting the spot nicely. (3.25) Mouthfeel: Very light and sessionable without being bone-dry. That's the bare minimum I look for in a session beer. Carbonation is slightly higher than normal, though hardly oppressive. (3.25) Overall: There's nothing amazing here, but it's a fine session beer regardless. Even among the style, it's not very complex.

You have to examine hard to decipher the aroma, but once you do you are rewarded with mild biscuit malt and jam-like fruit. The earthy hops don't come out until the first sip, where they're met by malt sweetness. The combination creates a bittersweet finish that is more smooth as opposed to biting. Apple and apricot in the flavor as well. Carbonation is low, adding to the smooth, slick feel.

The smell reminds me of their ESB, which I’m familiar with. Tangerine and flower petals. This has prompted me to check the ingredients, and indeed both beers use the exact same hops and malts according to the website. I’m now expecting a lighter version of the same brew. After tasting, that’s exactly what I get. This really seems like the same recipe, but with a bit less of everything. I get the same flavors - orangey jam, biscuity malt, a clean dry hop, and a bit of toastiness on the aftertaste. At first I was disappointed, but then I remembered that I love the ESB.

There's also a slight mustiness on the nose, but in no way is this a bad thing. I've gone on record noting positive mustiness in beers before. I think it adds a degree of complexity to a few different styles. The taste centers heavily upon the bread and fruit, and goes out on a masterfully balanced mixture of caramel sweetness and mild hop bitterness, resulting in a not too sweet, not too dry exit.

""Fuller's London Pride"" 330 ml brown glass bottle, ""BEST BEFORE: 01 JULY 17"" and sampled on 29 NOV 16 $2 @ Giant, St. Davids, PA A fairly rough pour brings up a full-sized head of slightly off-white cream atop a clear body of deep amber. It steadily settles into a denser cap, leaving short walls of lace clinging to the glass. With each sip those walls are broken up into patches of spotty lace.  Ahhh! Smell that Fuller's yeast. It's fruity and juicy and floral and mineralish. There's apple and pear, and I don't mean this in a bad way, but it's almost like they're rotting, as if they've gone as far ripe as they possibly could before they've started to break down, and now there's a little something else going on. It's almost a touch musty, or am I thinking damp mineral like you might find in a basement? Beyond that there's a bit of brioche-like bread, and floral and mildly grassy hops. It reminds me of a field in summer. The flavor opens up the maltiness of course, and it's much wider and fuller. There's a bit of an almost-burnt sugar like caramel at the front, and then more golden caramel going into the finish. The fruitiness remains but its veiled by the malt, although the mineral still comes through clearly, as do the hops in the finish. A stiff bitterness braces it throughout, but then comes forward in the finish, pushing aside some of the residual malt sugars and drying it. Floral hops, fruit, and mineral remain, swirling at the back of the mouth.  In the mouth its smooth with a medium-light body and fine-bubbled, moderate carbonation that's just delicately bristling. For fans of English ales this is one of the finest, offering a brilliant yeast character, a perfectly balanced caramel maltiness, and just the right amount of bitterness and carbonation to leave it exceptionally drinkable.

Not very assertive though.  That complexity sure continued in the flavor, as it follows the nose accurately.  Upfront you detect a nice and high carbonation, and the onslaught of one multifaceted flavor. The notes are well blended in, you get the bitter and the sweet side at the same time. Balanced beer but I'd say it tilts toward bitterness.  Prominent flavors are earthy hoppiness, citric as in orange, grass, cream, caramel.

Comes in a nice looking and distinctive 330ml bottle. 

London Pride is a decent ale from England’s Capital city. 

Pours a lovely amber reddish colour with some white head that faded quickly. Some light lacing is seen. 

The aroma is of some biscuit malts and earthy hops with hints of caramel sweetness. Nice. 

A lovely refreshing flavour which hits the taste buds immediately. It tastes of light caramel, some earthy and earthy hops with a mild bitter aftertaste. It has a different, subtle, complex taste to it than what you can expect from a lot of beers, which has to be appreciated. 

I also found it a bit strong in the taste which I enjoyed, more of a kick to it than other ales.

Not the best looking beer I have ever come across in the style but it is pretty on point for type and is by no means unpleasant to the eye.  Smell - Sweet malts are evident from the offset with some hints of plum and grape with caramel and floral tones. There is also some light bitter hop aroma. Taste - Almost identical to the smell profile. There is notes of plum and grape style fruit, light caramel sweet malts and enough bitter hop to make it very well balanced. there is also some boozy character to the flavour but is is not over powering and adds to the overall experience. MF - Mildly astringent mostly due to the boozy character. This beer has good body and a nice long lived linger that encourages further drinking. Overall - well balanced and very drinkable this beer is again a fine example of the style and a good ambassador for the British style which tends to be more rounded and balanced than the new wave of hop forward beers.

I had a high expectation about this beer, at the start I found a bit of disappointment, as with this I realized that I am more into darker beers, but after a couple of drinks (and a little better temperature) I started to juge this as a more neutral point, and I really found it amazing, maybe not my favourite beer, but absolutely one of the best I've tasted so far, a smooth flavor not so bitter to be heavy, but bitter enough to taste marvelous.",2014-12-05,222,Fuller's London Pride

On shelf in store. Stored at 42 degrees and served at 58 degrees (Per bottle instructions) in a hand washed and dried imperial pint glass. Appearance – 4. First pour – Light yellow, clear. Body – Amber, clear. When held to the light, bright orange. Head – Large (Maximum 5.5 cm, aggressive center pour), off-white, initially fizzy but quickly calming, medium density, short retention, diminishing to a four to fourteen mm jagged crown and thin partial cap.  Lacing – Fair. As the level drops, irregular bands of tiny to small bubbles remain. Aroma – 4 – Strong sweet caramel, malt, weak earthy hops.  Flavor – 3.5 – Malt forward but less caramelly than the nose suggests. Some distinct earthy hops are the aftertaste dominating my palate. No alcohol taste or aroma (4.2 % ABV), no diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide.  Palate – 3.5 – Medium, watery, soft carbonation.

Warm, grainy taste; dull sweetness; suggestion of honey; strong yet balanced hop bitterness. Medium body; nice residual sugar presence; crisp with a fairly dry quality overall. This beer delivers a very fine malt-forward experience, doing an excellent job of balancing toasted grain and hop bitterness flavors throughout the taste. I can't say I picked up on the label's descriptions of ""soft fruitiness with a faint hint of geranium"", but it certainly brings a nice flavorful nuttiness and bitterness to the palate.

Aromas of noticeable apple core and plenty of herbal fruity esters (if a composting fruit salad could possibly smell good, this would be that case); plenty of earthy tones and a subtle black tea round out the bouquet. Taste brings a straightforward bready malt/earthy/slightly spicy hop balance to go with minor herbal tones, bits of zesty, fruity funk, and a hard mineral component; tightly-composed, strong herbal bitterness along with the faintest berry fruitiness pop into focus as the finish fades. Mouthfeel shows a medium-light body with lower carbonation; very dry throughout, and finishes mostly clean against only a mild bitterness. Unique in spots, but never hits that next level; the bitterness in the profile really didn’t hang around long enough to express itself.

Smells a subtle floral arrangement backed by quasi-juicy malts. The same balance comes through in the Taste, then the bitter hops dominate at the finish to make the dry.

Light honey golden color to the liquid. Soft, sudsy ring of off-white foam down to the bottom. Quite a lovely intensity of flavor matching the aroma. Clean and crisp body, immensely quaffable (in large volume). I really must endeavor to practice coaxing such sublime taste and drinkability from lower gravity in my own brewing. Can't be too difficult, huh? This is easily in the top tier of bitters I've had so far.",2014-06-09,828,Bluebird Bitter

Had this again on 2015-12-30 in Columbia, PA from a 16.9 oz bottle A - Pretty clear amber-gold with a 1-finger white head and mild lace. S - Lightly roasted grain, nut, light fruit. T - Biscuit, nuts, grass, white grape, citrus, tea.. Mild roast and earthy hop bitterness. Finishes dry with an excellent clean, lingering finish of all the well-balanced flavors. Delicious. M - Light body and light-medium carbonation. Crisp and refreshing.  O - An excellent brew. Lots of flavor. Would have this in my fridge year round if it was available and affordable.

Aroma of biscuit malt, slightly floral, light grassy hops and a metallic hint. Flavor follows, mild biscuit malt and grassy hops with a surprisingly floral character. Finishes with mild hop bitterness and a hint of sourness. Light bodied. A fairly modestly flavored light bitter, but with some nice subtle elements like the hops that make it stand out.

3.64,4.5,3.0,3.75,4.0,3.75,"From: Binny's, Champaign, IL Date: None, ""F14 115"" stamped on label Glass: Standard US pint glass Bluebird Bitter is a subtle, understated version of the style with fairly clean, obvious maltiness and delicate hop nuances. Good, and interesting, but the subtlety is at times a bit too much, detracting from the characters being fully present. Further, the high price ($5 per 16oz bottle) doesn't necessarily invite repeated partaking. Probably not one I'd revisit. Pours a generous 2cm head of off-white foam, bubbles quite small in size, lending a dense, fluffy look to the mass. Retention is about one and a half minutes, slightly above average. Lacing is excellent, a thick sheet clings, unbroken, to the entire perimeter of the glass. The body is a dark golden brown color, with light bringing out pale, golden yellow hues. Carbonation is visible through the hazy (40-50% opaque) body, rising at a moderate pace, in similar numbers, from the bottom of the glass. Aroma is very mild, requiring one to inhale somewhat deeply, of light pale malt elements that contribute sweet graininess, supported by characters of bitter and herbal hops. Fairly simple flavor profile, very mild pale malts with a faint hint of toasted bread, diluted tea, and lightly bitter, floral, and herbal hops. Front of palate features clean, crisp pale malts lending slightly sweet grain and bread, with tea and fruity esters. Mid-palate is of simple pale malt graininess with a light caramel malt touch to lend mild toastiness, blended well with mild bittering and herbal hops. Back of palate finds pale malt sweetness with a bit of toasted malt and lightly bittering hops with a slightly leafy, herbal edge. Aftertaste is of pleasant, lightly sweetened graininess associated with Maris Otter and perhaps a bit of biscuit malt, blended with a touch of lightly bitter and herbal hop characters. Beer is of medium-light body, with medium-low levels of carbonation. Closes dry, with modest stickiness remaining on the palate and lips.",2013-08-12,828,Bluebird Bitter

Coniston Bluebird Bitter has a thick, creamy, off-white head and an initially clear, somewhat bubbly, orange-gold appearance, with prominent lacing left on the glass. When I aggressively swished the bottom of the bottle (16.9 oz.), the caked sediment added a tan cloud to the beer. Aroma is of light, sweet, aged toffee, sugar, and bit of citrus. The taste is of white bread, zinging yeast, a dash of citrus, subdued bitterness, and grain. Mouthfeel is mostly light and a bit watery, and Coniston Bluebird Bitter finishes wet, semi-sweet, and highly quaff-able.

Nutty with some tart yeast notes that fades slowly to a grassy bitterness not unlike wheatgrass, fading more to a copper, more in your face bitterness.

Although I've had this at the brewery pub years back I couldn't really remember anything about it: I still don't. Light amber body with a thin white head. Aroma was fairly weak: malty mostly, but after the initial caramel hints a fruity, more hoppy smell arrives. The taste is also malts initially with a fruitier and dry hoppy underbelly. Pleasant enough and my first beer at the Real Ale Festival the club was holding.

(i'm from the city- forgive me if i come across as a moron here). the 'bitter' didnt have a place in this until i added the sediments but i really like the flavor and the slight 'bitterness'. the liquid is full and flavorful and is filling me up. much like a heavy liquid such as milk 'fills you up', this brew seems heavy in that way after it falls to the stomach. overall, i really like this. it is a superb new try for me and i love the flavor and the 'bitterness'. i am a bit concerned, however, that if i'm going to get this full on a beer i'm hoping it gets me where i need to be (ie. high abv) before i fill up. unfortunately, i'm not a light weight anymore..",2012-09-08,828,Bluebird Bitter

Taste is very nice, soft malts, a fruityness, citrus hops come through gently, finish is a nice bitterness on the back on the tongue. Feel is light/medium bodied, smooth and pleasing with the carbonation aiding a refreshing moreish feel.

Head shows moderately high retention and some nice, sticky lacing. Aroma-White bread, grain, and grassy, hay-like malt with a touch of caramel in the background. Hops are lightly floral and earthy-green, but present. Some light fruity esters (apple and orange) from the yeast complement the malt profile. Flavor-Soft bread and hay-like malt quickly gives way to crisp apple esters with a touch of honey. Mid-palate has light biscuit malt and some orange notes before a firm, yet gentle moderate bitterness comes through in the finish along with herbal and earthy hop flavors. Yeasty notes with light orchard fruit and subtle hop tones carry long into the aftertaste. Mouthfeel-Medium body with soft, gentle, moderate carbonation. Moderately dry finish but never astringent. Do bottled bitters from England get better than this? I'm always skeptical of bitters coming from England-since it's such a delicate style it's no wonder that so many of them don't make the journey to the US in good condition. However, this one somehow manages to preserve many of the lovely, subtle nuances that make bitters what they are-low alcohol, fruity yeast notes with a touch of earth, multi-faceted malt profile, and light but firm hop presence.

With so many ostensible session ale's out there it's great to find one that finally can be a claimant to that title while maintaining a plethora of flavors and a modicum of perfection. American imbibers be not fooled by the low ABV or the obscure style. English bitters can satisfy the craving for hops just as much as any American IPA while hydrating the body.  This beer pours a golden rod color with a huge foaming billowing egg-shell head. The brewers really got the right amount of yeast in this bottle conditioned beer. The head leaves big clouds of lacing on the side of my pint glass.  The smell is amazing. This beer does smell like tea, English tea. Then big amounts of herb and flowers waft gently from the beer. Chamomile, lavender, germanium. daffodil. Lemon zest. The taste is bitter. I love the germane bitterness of the challenger hops. The bitterness comes right up front does its job and then fades gently into a nice sweetness. There is so much flavor in this little doll of a beer. Mild caramel malts, like the kind your grandmother would host in her candy bowl. Spices and fruits, particularly apple and orange.  The mouthfeel is chewy and drying while remaining hydrating ,refreshing, and sweet. The body is almost tea like with a light seltzer water fizz. I am awed by this beer. I think it is world class. If this beer were more widely available I would drink it all the time. I wish I could go to England and try more bitters. Until then, this is the top English bitter on my list. Bravo!

Aroma of white wine, apple cider and a sage like spiciness. Mouthfeel: soft like only English water can make it. Taste: bready malt with a slight fruitiness followed by a sharp bitterness. Notes: Bluebird is a bottle conditioned ale. The bottle says this was the CAMRA Supreme Champion Beer of Britain in 1998. It also says the glass that won was served at 58 degrees Fahrenheit. My glass is probably around 50 degrees. This is a well made beer but I'm not sure how much I like it. The strong hop bitterness is slightly offputting.

Crisp, lively, refreshing and highly palatable. It dances on the tongue, it affirms life it gets you silly with verse. The bite slowly fades to a warming aftertaste.

The aroma is pretty light, but what you can get is mostly grassy and citrus hops. There is a little bit of discerned sweetness that I believe is coming from the malts, but can't be sure just yet. Now this is really nice. The expected bitterness is there bringing grassy notes and a bit of grapefruit. The malts balance this nicely making the bitterness very bearable. The malts are responsible for the sweetness and after really contemplating that flavor element separately I find that the grains in this remind of of Sugar Smacks cereal, but not as sweet. That means that the barley is really shining here and was well caramelized.  The body is medium and it is indeed bitter, but not puckering.

Very muted nose, can only just barely make out a tiny hint of vague generic hop scent, I am disappointed. The thing that this beer does do rather well, however, is in the taste. There is plenty of long drawn-out gentle generic bitterness that ebbs and flows across your tongue like a pleasant ocean current. Now that...that part is at least well done if not overly monotone. Perhaps as an effect of my bottle not being quite as fresh as it ought to be, I am detecting absolutely none of the fruity notes commonly perceived by other BA members....and this really hurts my overall impression quite a bit.

Thin, but not in a drinkable way. Thin, like where'd the rest of it go? O- The grainy finish and lack of depth hurts this beer.

3.83,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,"A: The beer is clear light copper in color and has a light to moderate amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a finger high off white head. S: There are aromas of toasted malts and caramel in the nose along with some hints of floral hops. T: A medium amount of bitterness stands out in the taste, but it isn't that strong or overpowering as you find in IPAs. There are some caramel flavors and notes of malty sweetness, particularly after the beer warms up. M: It feels light-bodied on the palate and has a light to moderate amount of carbonation. D: Drinking this beer is a breeze, and it's very sessionable.",2011-02-10,828,Bluebird Bitter
4.1,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,"Golden caramel body is crystal clear, thin white head. Aroma is all English hops. Herbal, medicinal, floral. The flavor is caramel, nutty, roasted peanuts, slightly fruity, then the hops kick in with an herbal burst of hops. Dry finish that reminds me of peanut shells for some reason. The body is crisp and sharp. This is probably the most authentic Bitter I have ever had and I am glad to finally have the experience. Not a life changing brew, but I know that if I iever make it to the UK, I will cherish the opportunity to drink beers like this from the cask all day long. If only they were cheaper, fresher and more readliy available.",2011-02-07,828,Bluebird Bitter
3.95,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,"1pt 9oz bottle poured into a pint glass. A: Light, clear golden/orange with a bubbly white one-inch head. Retention is decent, and the head leaves behind delicate rings of lacing. S: Grainy, biscuity, lightly toasted malt base. Hops are herbal and vaguely citric and floral. T: Biscuity malt, a bit of a clovey/metallic taste, bitter grassy hop notes, vague delicate floral taste, quick fruity notes (oranges?). Very mild diacetyl. Finishes with some toasted grain, grassy hops, and faint tropical fruity notes. Very dry. M: Light in body, lively seltzer-like carbonation from the bottle conditioning. Lush and creamy. D: It's a session ale. If it wasn't drinkable, it would probably have to be an automatic 'D.' Notes: Pretty good I suppose. I seems pretty spot-on for the style, though the very active carbonation was a bit of a distraction. I personally feel rather indifferent toward it, but bitters have never really been a favorite style of mine. If you like session ales, you will want to give this one a try.",2011-02-02,828,Bluebird Bitter
3.83,3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,"Had the chance to have this a few times, but never got around to it. I love hombrewing session beers, particularly British Bitter so I'm excited to try this. No indication of freshness date. It has a stamp - F12 088 A - Pours with a full head. Settles in will pillow and fluff indicating some protein structure in the head. Glass laces where it started. Color is yellow and fairly clear. S - Mild esters and butterscotch. Very subtle. T - More butterscoth diacetyl taste. Then the hop bitterness sets in. Very balanced beer, but the hop bitterness shines through. M - More carbonation that I would have imagined. The carbonic bite in the mouth is noticeable. Did not expect that. This beer is very very drinkable. It is thin and quaffable, yet the bready malt and challenger hops make it interesting. Nice session beer that makes you want to take large sips. The pint goes bye bye before you know it.",2010-12-18,828,Bluebird Bitter
4.1,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,"A: nice golden orange, yellow, big one inch stable head that fades with a sip. S: fruity floral aroma with earth tones. T: grain, hint of sweet bitterness.  M: smooth, medium/light body blended with fair amount of carbonation.  D: great session beer. The low ABV makes this a winner for any party or time of year. Smooth med/light body can get you drinking more than a few with ease.",2010-12-14,828,Bluebird Bitter
3.12,3.5,4.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,"Cask fest at Cole's 2010; A nice fruity hop aroma. A light peachy colour with a whispy white head. Both Sourish and hoppy characteristics, caramel. Whole thing does not work as I am not tasting a bitter. Not too drinkable, and apparently wasn't even from the 48 hurs previous that it arrived.",2010-12-06,828,Bluebird Bitter
3.91,4.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,"500 mL bottle The beer appears crystal clear and orange with but a few bubbles randomly ascending to the head. The head is an awesome sight - fluffy and creamy white that cakes the glass with a thick sheet of lacing. I love the appearance of a good English ale.  Aromas include malts, rye bread and subdued floral notes. The beer tastes good. It has a bready or biscuity taste that seems appropriate for the style. Overall, it's pretty simple and straightforward. This seems like a good choice for washing down some fish and chips and watching rugby. The body is fairly thin with a lower than expected carbonation level. The beer finishes dry and with a healthy amount of bitterness that I find pleasant (that's undoubtedly the intention). A solid beer and a good session ale.",2010-11-17,828,Bluebird Bitter
2.68,3.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Reviewed from notes. On cask at Rustico - Alexandria. Pours a moderate golden-yellow color with a bit of light haze. White head with a bit of lacing. Nose brings some light floral and citrus hops as well as mild bread. A bit of butter. Taste brings hints of diacetyl again with a slight amount of light hops. Feel is creamy without much of any bitterness or sweetness. Overall, fairly plain with a few off flavors. Nothing really major wrong with it, but it really didn't bring all that much to the table.",2010-11-09,828,Bluebird Bitter
4.38,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,"50cl bottle from K&amp;L Redwood City. Damn this is a good session beer! Really wowed me. Pours a brilliant clear deep golden color with a thick, lasting white head and excellent lacing. Aroma is pleasant - honey, tea, herbal and floral hops. Flavor is excellent for a beer like this. So much going on for a subtle, low-ABV beer. Sweet malt, honey, caramel, and a great hop profile - herbal, floral, and a little citrusy. Very well-balanced. Palate is incredibly smooth with medium-light body and lasting dry bitterness from the hops. Really a great mouthfeel. So this is what a good English bitter is like, is it? I like it. Drinkability is absolutely off the charts insane. This is so easy to take down. I would love to try this on cask, and will definitely be going for this again if I see it. Incredibly sessionable at 4.2%.",2010-10-14,828,Bluebird Bitter
3.98,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,"Pours a slight copper color with a one-finger head into my glass. Nothing out of the ordinary. Aroma is full of sweet, buttery malt upfront with just a hint of hops behind it. Taste is mostly full of sweet, buttery malt with just a slight hint of hops. Visceral and not quite in the good way. Can't go wrong with Maris Otter and Challenger hops though.  Mouthfeel is full of lingering buttery malt. Not much else to go by here.  What we have here is a beer that's drinkable and different enough to where it'll probably get a dozen crappy reviews. I'm certainly not a Brit (unless you count the ONE Brit ancestor in my family) but I think this beer hits the spot as it is.",2010-09-04,828,Bluebird Bitter
3.56,4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,"Pours a nice golden light brown. Nice white head. Aroma is ok, a little malts. Flavor is intersting, VERY biscuity with a nice malt finish. Also a very creamy flavor which leads to the really nice mouthfeel on this beer. This also gives this brew a great drinkibilty. However the taste is just ok, I have had better examples of the style.",2010-09-01,828,Bluebird Bitter
3.46,4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,"Poured from 500mL bottle into a pint glass. Appearance: light golden-orange hue with a touch of haze. Head is a thick finger of frothy, light-ivory foam. Rather nice. Smell: light malt and earthy hops, but with a bizarre plasticy scent which I don't really like at all. Not sure what it is, but this beer would be much better without it. Taste: light malt which is quite biscuity. Hops provide a very well-rounded, earthy bitterness toward the end which I really rather like. Unfortunately a hint of the plastic is present up front, but it dissipates quickly. Without that this would be a pretty tasty beer. Mouthfeel: medium body with a really good carbonation. Creaminess is very good; I like it a lot. Drinkability: quite drinkable; sessionable, even. Sadly, this plastic cannot be ignored.",2010-08-27,828,Bluebird Bitter

Toasty malt aroma, earthy hops, slight citrus and floral notes. Moderate bitterness, slightly sharp in the finish. Clean flavour, some fruitiness from the hops, floral and toasted. Medium to light bodied with moderate carbonation, fairly dry, nice texture. This is pretty good. Refreshing and nicely balanced.",2010-07-26,828,Bluebird Bitter
4.2,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.0,4.5,"Obtained from a nearby large liquor store. Poured from a 50cl bottle into a regular pint glass. Bought it because it was a friend of mine's bitter of choice. Appearance: Golden or straw or maybe a touch orange-ish. Lacey tan white head that dissipated into an uneven and rocky remainder that still looked beautiful. That remained through the glass. Also really looked wonderful during the pour. Remains effervescent, and I thought, well, maybe a bitter should be a little less carbonated than this -- hopefully some day I can try it nitro or casked. Smell: Yeast, bread, malt profile noticeable. I think I detect a light note of citrus and stonefruit, which is a very nice touch.  Taste: I taste a full profile of maris otter malt and a finishing flavor of challengers. It's full enough bodied, and it's crisp. If it has a defect, I would say that the malt/hop balance might need to be tipped just a bit to the mals. Mouthfeel: As I mentioned earlier, I wish this was nitro or cask, but this is partially a function of the serving method. Less carbonation would make this better. The character of a classic bitter would be way more obvious. It's not without charm and the body comes through. Drinkability: Yes, very drinkable. I could drink more of thiss. Much more. And hovering around 4% alcohol, what's gonna stop me?",2010-07-21,828,Bluebird Bitter
4.24,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Poured from a 500mL bottle into my Dogfish Head shaped pint glass.  Clear golden poppy and sunglow liquid with a very pale papaya whip, lasting, soapy head. Delicate merengue lacing. The aromatics are stunning really - immense floral and fruity nose full of fresh Challenger hops. Pineapple/mango/apricot, kumquat, geraniums (as the label says), along with fresh-cut hay, and a very lightly toasted maltiness. Heavenly. Lemon zest and faint buttermilk palate entry - which gives way to a crackery maltiness, floral hops, and a steady quinine bitterness. Brisk yet slightly biscuity with hints of marmalade and sulfur in the finish.  Light-bodied, good carbonation, and refreshing.  Thoroughly enjoyable - I wish I had access to casks of proper English Bitters, as otherwise this is probably the best example of the style I have available to me...",2010-05-19,828,Bluebird Bitter

The hops have a light spice accent and mild pine aspects, there is also a mild lemony tinge M - The feel is smooth with low carbonation level and mild toasted texture w/ silky feel and light yeasty tang.

4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Coniston Brewery: Bluebird Bitter (No freshness date) (Tasted 01/21/08) 16.9 oz. bottle: poured into a tulip pint. Appearance: Deep golden with amber hues. Head is fizzy and white, decent formation, great retention. Odor: Bread crust with a faint spicy, flowery hop aroma in the background. Fruitiness is very evident in the nose. Consistency: Light body, consistency is admirably full for a bitter. The carbonation provides a slight creaminess countered by the crisp, puckering tannic dryness on the palate.  Taste: Grassy, tobacco leaf hop flavors lay over the soft toasted bread flavors with a firm but subdued bitterness in the background. Fruitiness flourishes in the dry, refreshing finish. I usually shy away from reviewing bottled English beer, as bottles from England tend to be very low-turnover items at any liquor store, this is an exception, relatively sure this was a fresh bottle. This is a great, solid beer. It's not too challenging and it's not supposed to be, no, it's remarkable that such a small beer packs as much flavor as it does.",2010-02-21,828,Bluebird Bitter

Bright pale amber/deep gold, it has a very big off-white head steadily shrinking to a thin foamy top and leaving some weak lace. The aroma is strong, airy-fruity grain with buttered toast, hint of caramel, fresh bread, lemon and hints of leafiness. It's wonderful, beautifully integreated so that oen can tell that there is a lot going one with both malt and hop yet not quite able to pull it all apart. The taste is similar, light but firm, and complex. It has clear lemon, hints of woody herbs, toasted grain, and a faint hint of sweet-sour fruit (plums and pear) before a dry, lightly bitter finish that is leafy with some lemon and grain. A light aftertaste of caramelly grain, lemon, herb and yeast then takes over. A light yeatiness runs throughout. Compared to, say Ridgeway Bitter, it is a little more bitter and leafy and less lemony and yeasty.",2009-10-29,828,Bluebird Bitter

S: The aroma is of light caramelized malts, citrus and a little bit of hops. T: The taste starts out sweet with flavors of citrus, caramel &amp; honey. Then there's a hearty malt character that comes in as the sweetness fades. The hops presence is moderate and brings a decent balance. The after-taste is slightly bready. M: Crisp and smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean and dry. D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, although this beer doesn't really live up to the ""bitter"" part of its name, it's still a good sessionable beer that is worth drinking for a long time.",2009-09-20,828,Bluebird Bitter
3.39,4.5,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,"500ml into a pint A - Pours a a dark golden color. Head formation is moderate, at about 1mm. Light white. Quickly dissipating to a somewhat well retained head. Very clear - no hazing or suspended yeast. S - A combination of pilsner malt notes and some english hops. Has some bready earthy notes in the background. T - Starts off malt strong, very sweet. Not much for special malts in the early flavors - fairly monolithic. Seems almsot pilsner like. Mid-stream is more of the same, with only the lightest hint of earthy british hops. Finishes with a bit of a bitter bite, which is not seen elsewhere in the beer. M - The low abv makes me think this beer was fermented with sugar retention in mind - hence I would say the body is pretty strong. Carbonation bite is present, not dominating. D - ABV is well within reason. Carbonation is a bit filling after one 500ml bottle. Not particularly overwhelming in flavors.",2009-09-04,828,Bluebird Bitter

Bitterness is low. Challenger hops I have found is not a favorite of mine. Light body with a nice carbonation. It is not as impressive as cask conditioned or nitro charged English ales that I have had the pleasure of drinking. Extremely easy drinking and quite enjoyable overall.

The head retained as a thin skim and left lots of web lace down my glass.  S= Light malt sweetness, fruity esters, and a wisp of hops. Basic but nice.  T= Again, a light biscuity malt sweetness giving just enough base to balance the fruity esters (mango and orange) and the hop bitterness. The hops were light and spicy and had a wisp of resiny oils. Finished moderately dry and crisp.  MF= Lighter bodied with a modest carbonation appropriate to the style. Felt delicate and balanced in the mouth.  D= Highly drinkable session bitter here.

Golden, with a reddish tint, good lacing. The nose is light citrus, and biscuity malt. It taste like it smells, sweets malts give way to hop bitterness, and citrus lingers in the aftertaste.

More of the earthy hops and a little floral hops in there for additional flavor. A really nice beer. This could easily be a sesssion beer to drink all night.

4.07,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,"Light, malty and delicious, Bluebird Bitter is, to me, a very English beer, and I'm happy to get a hold of a bottle around here. It has a very nice, sweet malt character balanced well by some floral-mineral hops. It's fairly dry for the caramel malt, but then it's not a very strong beer. The lack of strength seems to take something away from the aroma, but I imagine this and all of my ratings would rise if I had it out of a cask at a pub near the brewery. It's a great session beer that actually lives up to the spirit of a session beer. One could have quite a few glasses of this stuff. The appearance is bright and amber with pretty good lacing. The flavor is nicely bitter from the hops with good balancing malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is very nice, creamy with gentle and fine hop bite. It's hard for me to really understand English Bitters having never been to an English pub with fresh casks.

Medium-bright yellow in color, it develops a tight head that lingers for the ride to the bottom of the glass leaving lace everywhere. There's a nice citurusy hops hit in the nose, somewhat mellowed by the malt. The taste is cleanly divided by earthy malt in the front, decent fizz in the middle and then a fruity, orange-peel, hoppy tang that goes all the way down the back of your throat. Low ABV is an advantage, too. An all-around great beer, neck-and-neck with Harviestoun's Bitter and Twisted.",2008-12-30,828,Bluebird Bitter

Some lacing and a nice head about a finger or two thick Smelt of spicy hops and light malt notes. Delicious. A moderate malt flavor with a surprisingly spicy hop finish. Session doesn't just mean the 4.2% alcohol!  Mouthfeel was impressive! Very solid body, which I would attribute to the bottle conditioning. Felt like there was something to chew on. Obviously, not as chewy as a thick stout or porter, but notable. Eminently drinkable. The 'session' moniker as witnessed on the bottle is often applied to brews with low alcohol. At 4.2%, this one isn't too too low, but it's remarkable taste and mouthfeel would make it a sessionable beer at 6.0%! I'd just need a ride home :) I feel inspired to search out some cask ales.

T - Like the nose, the flavors are very understated in the traditional British brewing tradition. Lots of lightly toasted whole grain bread lightly smattered with butter and orange marmalade.

Appearance – Dark amber with minimal carbon activity in the glass. A single finger of cream head that dies fairly quickly to a lace cover and leaves web lacing down the sides of the glass.

Smell – Heavy musty and bitter hop aroma similar to coffee filters is the first and most dominant aroma. This is followed by oak and pine wood.

Taste – There is a clear burnt toffee like taste that combined with the bitter coffee element makes this beer taste rather like a coffee cake however in this beer there is a final bitter folourish that is really quite special. At the back there is a final phenolic smokey spice that, to continue the metaphor, is just icing on an already well make cake.

Mouthfeel – Reasonably full in the mouth and rather creamy! This beer has long lived linger and a lovely pinch that tingles in the gums and back of the throat for ages. A cracking overall sensation.

Overall – This Ale is really special. It is very like a bridge between a standard Ale and a good Bitter. This beer pleases, excites and satisfies in equal measures. I can best describe this by saying it is a great ambassador for British brewing.",2014-10-12,305,Spitfire Premium Kentish Ale

From the bottle: ""The Bottle of Britain""; ""This 4.5% Kentish Ale was first brewed in 1990 to celebrate the Battle of Britain which was fought in the skies above Kent 50 years earlier."" One wag told me that its unofficial motto is ""Spitfire - downed all across England!"" Ha! If it is only ""Kentish"", what might a full-on Kent beer be like? It was a small, 11.2-fl. oz. bottle, so I thought that I could invert it until the pseudo-cascade began and foam began approaching the top of my glass at an alarming rate. It settled into two puffy fingers of tawny head with good retention. Color was a solid amber (SRM = 13) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a soft, buttery quality, undoubtedly from using hard water in its production. Biscuit malts were also present and I watched the head slowly fall, leaving some nice lacing in its wake as I anticipated that first sip. Mouthfeel was medium and the flavor was bready, biscuity, buttery and slightly sweet. I am guessing East Kent Goldings hops for a mild grassiness. In keeping with the style, this was much more restrained than its American counterparts and as such, was a nice change of pace for yours truly. I rarely truck in either imports or bottles and so this was a rare treat. Its relative mellowness was like a cup of tea after that coffee porter.

A bit of varnished wood and cedar. Smells of a pub.  T: Tastes good, the firm, dry, toasted malt base reminds me of England as I remember it in the late 70s, of pubs, smoke and toasted whole grain bread.

3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"It's no wonder Spitfire is sold in clear bottles - if I had a such a tanned, sexy blood orange body I'd want to show it off too (well, that's kind of a lie, I'd probably go see a doctor). It's an appearance that takes the tone of the marmalade and toffee notes of its aroma. It's an ESB with a lovely colour, gummy head and lace, and a clear, glistening complexion. I'll just come out and say it: Spitfire will be boring to some. It's not its fault, it's just the style. North American ales are often distinguished by their aggressive hopping - magically enchanting notes of pine resins, tropical fruits, and alpha acids so sharp you can cut your finger on them - but British ales gain their distinction by more subtle means and are far more understated by nature.  The noteworthy features of this one are, as in so many others, not especially noteworthy at all: stiff water minerals, an unembellished maltiness, and the odd yeast ester. The result is a beer that drinks like a seltzer water infused with toffee and dried fruits. There's not a ton of character beyond the customary toffee-ish malts, marmalade sweetness, the odd raisin-like nuance, and...  the three varieties of distinctly spicy and pungent Kent hops! This might not pack the IBUs or flamboyant fruitiness of an American IPA, but its hoppiness is no more easy to miss. The mouthfeel has a vegetal kind of bitterness - like the center of a raw cabbage - that almost simulates chewing on an actual hop (something I don't recommend). It's very herbal. It's only befitting that a beer released to commemorate the Battle of Britain - brewed by Britain's oldest brewery - be so quintessentially British. There's no mistaking this as an ale from any other part of the world; its hard water profile, biscuity malts, dried fruit esters, spicy hops, and mild, approachable manner are the very things that define the proud English brewing tradition.",2014-02-25,305,Spitfire Premium Kentish Ale
3.64,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Served on tap in a pint glass Appearance – The beer is served a copper color with a one finger of tan colored head. The head has a good level of retention, slowly fading to leave a moderate level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma of the beer is quite heavy of a lightly toasted smell as well as a big aroma of toffee and a grainy smell. Along with these aromas are some lighter fruit smells as well as a bit of a more earthy and herbal hop aroma.  Taste – The taste begins with a lighter toasted malt and bready flavor mixed with a light caramel and toffee flavor that procures an overall crisp taste. Along with these flavors are some lighter hop tastes of a more earthy nature. The sweeter flavors of caramel and toffee begin fading producing a very crisp taste overall. With a bit more of a herbal and earthy hop coming to the tongue at the very end, one is left with a pleasant and crisp, lightly toasted malt and moderately bitter flavor to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is quite light with a carbonation level that is on the higher side. Both are fantastic for the moderate flavors of the brew and for the crisper feel making for one very refreshing beer. Overall – A refreshing and easy drinking, crisp brew.

M -- Smooth and soft mouthfeel, that finishes moderately dry, with a medium body.

A - Pours just over a finger of fluffy soapy doughy tan head on top of a burnt coppery orange colored body with excellent clarity. Nice fat cavernous lacing. Fairly average to look at, but appealing. S - Smell is fairly simplistic also, but pleasant enough. Clean grainy English malt, caramel / bread malt, corn, musty yeast, herbal grassy notes, and some indistinct peppery /vegetal qualities. T - This is some pretty blahhh stuff. Extremely dry papery grains permeate the taste. Wet paper, grains, bready malt, and some mineral well water. M - Feel is extremely dry, bready, and coarse. Medium bodied with appropriate carbonation. Overall, I found this to be a pretty poor beer, with bad intensity and duration of flavor, and somewhat imbalanced.

Of course I do, it was some big affair involving planes, stiff upper lips and bombing of London thrown into the mix, they even made a movie, what a silly question Mr. Neame. Kentish ales are a real classic style of ale and a great way to facilitate the average UK pub talk of crap weather, who's the biggest slapper in town and Premier league football (almost said 'soccer' there), and I'm a bit of a fan of a good tap poured EPA, however they never seem to taste as good from the bottle. Poured from a 500ml bottle into a nonic pint. A: Perfectly clear copper body with a fairly proud creamy head on top - looks the part. S: Straight on the nose with those delightful earthy Fuggles hops and a hit of caramel malts fills out the aroma. There is also a freshness to the aroma that is very welcoming - this is brewed old school. T: Balanced flavour here; the hops add a citrus tang and the caramel malts come through on the back palate. Nothing is over-powering and if you were looking for a hop laden brew then you should really be drinking an American pale anyway. Good work on the balance Mr. Neame. There is a slight metal twinge in the after-taste, this is discouraging. M: Light carbonation with a medium body. Well rounded in this department. D: All very textbook EPA... hell these guys probably wrote the book on Kentish ales so it's no surprise how ""pub-friendly"" this beer tastes. Apart from that slight metal after-taste I could not fault it as a typical English ale, it conjures up memories from my own experiences in the UK and for that it wins my hard-earned praise.

3.52,4.0,3.25,3.75,3.0,3.5,"500 mL bottle; one of the last major EPAs available at the LCBO that I still have not tried. Pours a bright orange-amber colour, generating a silky cream-coloured head a little more than a finger thick. Decent retention; it lasts for a few minutes before settling to a creamy cap and collar, leaving behind smears of lacing on the glass. Not a bad looking brew at all. The smell is skunky at first (clear bottles - sigh), but a little time to breathe allows the actual aromas to come through - lots of bready, biscuity malts alongside toffee, some fruity esters and a solid leafy, herbal hop bitterness. More lightly toasted bread and biscuits in the flavour, as well as hints of sweet toffee and pears. Unmistakably English in character, the hops are very leafy and a bit earthy, herbal and a little tea-leaf-like; providing a nice dryness that leads into the finish and lingers a bit for a musty aftertaste. Light-bodied, with heavy, biting carbonation. It works alright here with the spicy hops but I'd prefer the carb level to be a bit milder. Easy to drink; I can easily see myself having a few pints of this for a session.  I am kind of on the fence about this stuff - it's certainly not a *bad* pale ale, but I'm not terribly enthusiastic about it either. Kind of a 'mixed bag'... I like the hop profile a lot, but the mouthfeel is too fizzy and thin. Looks great, but stinks like skunk when you open it. Final verdict? Spitfire is a decent session ale worthy of a try, but not much more than that, and there are many others in this style I'd recommend before it. [Updated Dec. 19 2013] I picked up another bottle for a four-way EPA showdown, a comparison that also included servings of Fuller's London Pride, Pedigree and St. Peter's English Ale. This isn't a bad pale ale at all, with a good dose of leafy, earthy hops leading into a pleasing, dry finish. I still think it's kind of thin, watery, and too fizzy, and with cheaper, comparable EPAs being not that hard to find, it's not something I anticipate I'll be returning to frequently.

This impression begins well to the taste bit it diappears as this beer stretches and then thins out before an encouraging slight tablet type quality at the end which is just a little too late to make up for the disappoinment of what it could have been or was.  Could have sworn this was better even when it was released as a bottle conditioned ale but sadly those days are long lost. A shame such a lacklustre beer should be named after such a great fighter. If it was up to me I'd rebadge it Boulton Paul Defiant.",2011-10-16,305,Spitfire Premium Kentish Ale
4.05,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.5,"500ml, clear bottle, nice Spitfire bulls-eye cap. An ode to the Battle of Britain, with that so English of constructs, the pun: hence, the 'Bottle of Britain'... This beer pours a clear medium golden amber hue, with one finger of foamy, somewhat creamy ecru head, which leaves a random drooping tree canopy of lace around the glass in its retreat to the Tube. It smells of bready biscuit malt, and bitter grassy, floral, dusty hops. The taste is more of that same bitterness up front, the slight mustiness tinging the grassy and earth character. Underneath, and not lagging by much, is a sturdy cereal/biscuit graininess, one which tugs nicely at the palate. The carbonation is present, but pleasant enough, the body medium-light in weight, and adequately smooth. It finishes fairly dry, the crisp grain and hops riding out in splendid unison. Well, the see-through bottle had me feeling a wee bit trepidatious, but that was soon dispelled - this is a well-balanced, yet still decently flavourful EPA - not a lot of that makes it to my 'hood.",2011-10-14,305,Spitfire Premium Kentish Ale

Reddy brown body with an off-white topping which hung around throughout the pint. The smell and taste can be easily combind, you'll find semi-sweet biscuits that contain toffee, caramel and nuts within the mix, towards the end of the mouthfeel a dry hoppiness pops up to remind you this is a proper beer.

4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,I love cans and I am very happy to see another UK canned beer in BC. The Spitfire is a fairly malty pale ale with a thickish mouthfeel that holds up to stronger foods such as burgers with blue cheese. The hops are decidely English in profile but not overtly flowery. A great EPA for when the nights get colder and with the can it tastes fresh.,2011-09-30,305,Spitfire Premium Kentish Ale
4.25,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,"Served in a nonic 20 oz tumbler at Nag's Head Belgravia/Westminster. It pours a deep copper amber color with a rather good-sized frothy off-white head. A strong tea-like hop aroma rises at first pour. Dry malt and a light wet hay background smell blend in. A light resinous hop and faint fruity smell arrives late. This is a classic Pale Ale in every way. Edgy tea-like and citrusy hops are slightly forward of the caramel malt backbone. Tastes of bone dry crackers, with a dose of tart pear peek through. Just beautiful!",2011-09-25,305,Spitfire Premium Kentish Ale

S - Aromas are of malts, grasses, citrus, hint of toffee/candy and light summer fruits.  T - Quite a variety of flavours on the palate here; first we have sweet fruits, biscuit malts, honey, caramel and a sort of syrupy sweetness, woody notes or a wood aged flavour, followed by a floral hoppiness.  MF - Medium carbonation, which I adds to the body and flavour, a reasonable light to medium, frothy mouthfeel. A delight to tumble about the palate indeed. O - A lovely Kentish pale ale that is quite delicious and has a character to its own.",2011-08-25,305,Spitfire Premium Kentish Ale
4.5,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.5,"A- Pours a rich rusty color with ample ample amounts of big burly carbonation rising to the top, and it's very persistent. The head is textured like sponge toffee at first, but then gets really dense and cloud like, and is slightly off white in coloration....it retains very well! The lacing is wonderful, as an English Bitter should be! S- There is wonderful aromas of citrus fruit flesh, and rich malt sweetness, that contains toffee/caramel. On the finish, I notice fresh, yet not overpowering hop flowers....very well rounded, if not a little mild, but very typically English! T- The flavors follow the aromas very closely, and the delivery is simply awesome! There is some malt toffee/caramel sweetness right up front, with a spicy citrus fruit and nutty softness in the middle. The finish is reasonably bitter, with more fresh Kent hops puckering the back of my tongue. I only put in that they're Kent hops b/c I know that's what they used ;) The aftertaste gets a little sticky sweet with a bit of caramilk chocolate bar coming to mind M- Once the carbonation settles down, this becomes a very frothy, creamy drink! It's clean on the palate, finishing in a quenching manner, leaving me craving the next swig of fine liquid! The body I find is solidly medium...not too thick, but definitely not watery! O- This one ranks among the best EPA's that I've tried to date! I love this style and the smooth, creamy, full flavored character of this one puts it right up there with the best in my opinion! Perfectly balanced, from sweet beginning to bitter end, this one has it all! Highly recommended!!",2011-08-05,305,Spitfire Premium Kentish Ale

3.78,4.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,"A 500ml clear glass bottle with a BB of June 2012. Brewed to commemorate the battle of Britain and the plane that won it. Poured into a Sam Smith's pint glass. A clear reddish-amber hue with good carbonation. Produces a large head of creamy off-white foam that lasts for a few minutes before reducing to a surface layer. Aroma of roasted malt with burnt notes, hints of caramel, butter, stewed hops, citrus and grass. A pleasing combination. Tastes of roasted malt with a dry bitter finish. Notes of roasted grain, caramel, and stewed hops with a hint of citrus. The bitterness is slightly harsh and has a leafy character. A buttery diacetyl note lurks in the background. Mouthfeel is smooth, tingly and rather astringent. Aftertaste of bitter roasted malt. A classic British ale. It might not be the best beer in the world but it's a fine example of an English bitter. A good depth of flavour with subtle bitterness, even if the aroma is better than the taste. One of Shepherd Neame's more worthy offerings.

Nice 2 finger head that is nice and fluffy, looks like it will last. S: Sweet bicuity malts. Not much going on in the way of hops on the nose. T: I get all biscuit and caramel in this one. Some floral hops to round it out, but the malts steal the show in this one. M: A little thin even with it being on cask. I can't imagine that the mouthfeel would be very good served from a bottle.

Mouthfeel - quite smooth with medium carbonation, almost a fresh clean mouthfeel, i quite like this.

3.6,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,"A: Pours a coppery amber with a big, fluffy cream-coloured head. Retention is good, gradually diminishing to a healthy layer of foam and leaving a fair amount of lacing. S: Fresh fruity and floral hops mingle with toffee malts. Hints of citrus, turbinado sugar, and biscuit malts round out the nose. T: Starts out with light, fruity hops and bready malts with a hint of honey, quickly giving way to pronounced toffee and nutty biscuit malts with loads of spicy, tangy, vegetal hop bitterness. M: Body on the heavy end of medium, particularly due to high carbonation. It lends a crisp, refreshing dimension to the chewy body, but soon feels gassy. The balance rather leaves something to be desired, too: the bold hop bitterness makes for a long, tangy finish and demands a follow-up sip, but it overpowers other nuances in the flavour. D: A decent English pale ale with a distinctly bitter, hoppy flavour. I find it skews the balance and makes the beer more finish than flavour, but it's certainly worth trying for yourself to see whether the tanginess suits your tastes.",2011-06-09,305,Spitfire Premium Kentish Ale
2.8,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,"Poured from a .5L bottle into an appropriately sized full pint glass. The body is a mostly clear reddish brown amber. The head rises up to about 1 finger before sitting there for a while. Sticky and resilient, it forms rings of lace that are connected by delicate spiderwebs, one ring for each sip. The glass is a beautiful thing to behold. The aroma brings with it notes of caramel and toffee in the foreground. Accompanying these malty characteristics are fruity esters and some earthy notes from the yeast and some grassy hop aromas with a touch of bitterness. The taste, unfortunately, falls considerably short of the bar set by the nose. Generally harsh on my palate, I find that the unpolished malt profile overpowers the desirable fruity esters and even the grassy hops that should combine to be focal points of this beer.  While the body and carbonation of this Spitfire Ale are pretty much on point, the harsh feeling and flavors that I find make the drinking experience generally unpleasant. Unfortunate, because I was really excited after the aroma and appearance were so damn good.",2011-06-04,305,Spitfire Premium Kentish Ale

Taste  Initially there's a light fruit sweetness, in the middle a caramel/toffee taste starts to come through and built up to a high before leaving a medium hop bitterness on the finish Mouthfeel Medium body along with a medium carbonation here which suits the beer perfectly, it gives the beer a nice acidity to the texture without affecting the flavour. Overall Pretty good session beer, perhaps not one of the more outstanding specialist beers but for a readily available session beer, this is hard to beat.

The tart/sourness spreads through the mouth and leaves you scraping your tongue ever so slightly..  D - The smell is easily the beer thing about this beer.

Bready and toasted malts with a nice hoppy graininess and a raisin-like fruit tone accented by a candy sweetness. The taste is the most bread-like I've encountered so far; it's kind of like the taste of pumpernickel or sourdough. A nice, spicy kick on the tonguue helps to balance before a well-hopped bitterness takes over. The mouthfeel is also unsurprisingly bready, maybe to excess. I find it a bit on the yeasty side and heavy on the tongue. Despite a fairly low ABV, I doubt I'd want more than on or two on any given day.

The initial taste was of a nice clean maltiness and slightly roasted flavor, with a pleasant fruitiness and slightly creamy sensation from the head. There's a distinct and rather pleasant mineral taste (perhaps from the water?). Towards the end of a mouthful, often the taste switches to a hoppy bitterness, not huge, but clear. These various flavors mix and meld for the entire pint (there's no ""weak finish"").

Very inviting aroma from this one. I can detect a hard-water-enhanced bitterness from the hops, toffee and some candied fruitiness.  And the taste is...pretty damn good. A delightful bitterness from the hops and a spiciness combine wonderfully. Also, as the smell suggests, some hints of candied fruits (pear/apple) and a slight caramel-like note in there from the malt. Definitely one of the better English Pale Ales I have had.

That incredible smell didn't translate into an overly hoppy brew taste, but lordy, it was still a great experience and something I will be buying again.",2009-11-11,305,Spitfire Premium Kentish Ale

The smell was nice, caramely malt and mild yet solidly bitter hops. The taste was good, a solid English ale tipical of the region. Caramel malt, wheat breat. and a nuttiness in the base. The hop finish well rounded the brew. The mouthfeel was ok, medium body, could use a bit better carbonation. MK",2009-11-08,305,Spitfire Premium Kentish Ale

3.48,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,"As soon as I spied this in N.S., and brought it home, I'd been waiting to try it (I've been drinking my summer haul according to expiration dates). It's a smart looking bottle, with a great amber colour. When poured, a tall, cream-coloured, smooth head forms. It falls fairly slowly, leaving some creamy lace. A floating medallion of foam stayed right 'til the bottom. When I cracked it open first, it smelled great. Reminded me of Innis &amp; Gunn. When in the glass, though, it reminds me more of pale European beers. OK, but not impressive.  The taste started out average, and got better after a few sips. I seem to gravitate towards the earthier beers and this is in that category. I don't care for the first half of each sip's aftertaste, but it mellows out afterwards a bit. Still could improve. In the mouth, it's a bit watery for the flavour. A bit more thickness/creaminess would match the flavour better.  As for drinkability, it's right on the cusp, you know? If it could just get over the hump in a few areas, it'd be a great beer. As it stands, it's a good beer worth trying. I'd try one in a pub, or maybe in a bottle again.",2009-09-21,305,Spitfire Premium Kentish Ale

4.03,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,Drinkability - A good beer that is easily drinkable. It's not my personal preference to go with an earthy hop flavoured beer but this one's worth a try. Appearance - a clear dark copper with a good thick head to start and recedes to a medium layer with great lacing.  Smell - clean hops slightly dominate over a lightly sweet caramel malt.  Taste - light malt in the start that transitions to a pleasing level of earthy hop flavours. Mild bitterness in the finish.  Mouthfeel - smooth and refreshing. Slightly creamy and no coursness. A good medium level of carbonation,2009-09-10,305,Spitfire Premium Kentish Ale
2.86,3.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,"Picked this up at the LCBO  From a bottle into a pint glass APPEARANCE: Big fluffy 3+ finger thinner looking off-white head mounds out of the glass. Russet in color, perfectly clear with lower end carbonation. Only a ring of foam remains until the end but manages to leave some minor lacing down the sides of the glass. Decent looking for the style.  SMELL: A grainy nose. There's some toasted malt and caramel notes. Not much here at all. Certainly weaker and less impressive than what I'd expect.  TASTE: The taste is certainly mild as well. Toasted malt, some caramel malt and notes of wood in there as well. Some floral hops round it off. Mild aftertaste has a touch of bitterness there too. Nice, but just not quite bold enough to really make a statement.  PALATE: Medium-thin body and slightly airy. A little light on the palate and not quite creamy enough. Goes down fine and finishes with an appropriate amount of dryness on the palate. A little lacking here in my view. OVERALL: Not a bad brew just not all that impressive. There are more interesting choices out there, though this one is certainly worth a whirl if you're a fan of the style.

Small wispy head that dissipates quickly. Smell: strong bitter smell, definitely a pale ale. Hints of wood, though not quite sure what to make of it. Taste: typical pale ale, ABV is perfect, but aftertaste is quite strong, soured my taste for it a bit.  Mouthfeel: just the right consistency, though if it was colder I might have liked it better.

Both scents are a foretaste of what's to come. Taste is light, refreshing and a mild citrus-sweetness, with some bitterness as well. Light carbonation makes for a refreshing drink, but this isn't necessarily what I want from an ale, personally. A lighter mouthfeel might be nice for a post-exercise lager, but leaves a little wanting for an ale. Overall a decent drink, just not my favorite, especially for an English ale.

3.85,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Appearance: Clearish cinnamon orange with an ivory head with fairly good retention, speckled with delicate bubbles. Smell: Hops, lightly cheesy and predominantly resinous/woody with a touch of lemon and white grape, provide the top notes. Behind them are the malts, exquisitely caramelly with just a hint of cocoa - too bad they aren't bold enough to distract from the hop cheese. Taste: Nice and robust, well balanced between the toffee/roasted nut malts and the juicy, leafy, sappy hops. There is also a glimmer of grapefruit, leading into a mostly hoppy finish with a leafy snap and lingering pithyness. Mouthfeel: Light and gently spritzy; a good match for the flavor, which needs a bit of snap to cut the malts, but not too much to keep the hops in check. Drinkability: The hops in this beer are too old, which seems a bit silly considering that this is a Kentish ale, but otherwise this is very nearly a world-class ale.",2009-07-16,305,Spitfire Premium Kentish Ale

4.2,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,"The first bar I went to when I moved to Portland was The Horse Brass Pub. The first beer I ordered was a YSB on cask. I've ordered more than a few since. A fellow BA pointed out some of the beer rock stars that were also there that night. Alan Sprints from Hair of the Dog, Guy Palmer from Lagunitas, and the man for whom that first pint was named after, Don Younger himself, seemingly having a great time. I'd never drank a beer in the presence of the person it was named for. If the beer would have sucked I suspect it would not have been as memorable. It was quite good though so that's a win in my book. Sadly the publican has passed since then leaving his legacy and memories behind. I won't claim to have actually met him and shook his hand because that would be a lie, but that's my memory of him. I don't think I will ever drink a YSB without remembering that first night in the Horse Brass. Its about noon right now after a long night shift and I'm just chilling at the bar with a freshly pulled pint. Here's to you Don. A: Nice amber color with a couple fingers of fluffy, dusty head. It recedes down to a nice full cap with some decent lacing. That's good stuff right there. 4/5 S: Nice, moderately sweet, lightly roasted malts are a pleasure to the senses. Some berry-esque qualities show up as a nice compliment as well. Floral, English hops show up to help the balancing act. Well done. 4/5 T: Here is where the beer absolutely shines for me. Nice mild amount of bittering is the initial introduction to the taste buds. Some tannins light up their sweet spots. Its not until after the swallow that the long slowly developing finish leads to the copious amounts of whole grain biscuit. Pairs fantastically with fried foods. 4.5/5 M: Smooth, lightly scrubbing, and clean. Just what I expect from a cask bitter. 4/5 O: Good beer.

Frankly also smells like a Rogue offering. Boring to say, but sometimes it applies so well. Flavor follows the aroma here. Toffee, some butter (diacetyl) and a finish with some mild citrus hops. And yes... it tastes like a Rogue Beer with the distinctive Pacman flavors. The finish is where the hops and lemon peel do come through.... Carbonation is very muted and just prickles at your tongue.

The color is a murky brownish orange color with no foam or head of any kind; it looked completely flat: turns out it was when I tasted it. The smell is of rotten sour malts. It also smells a bit nutty, a bit soapy. But mostly it smelt very stale: kind of smelt like old stale bread and old rotten yeast. The taste is utterly disgusting. It tasted of off malts. A rotten nut taste as well is apparent. It tasted slightly sour with a gross honey aftertaste. There is also this disgusting rotten yeasty flavor to the beer. Zero carbonation is in the beer and it was served at seventy degrees, I kid not. The overly warm temperature was hard to handle: cask should not be cold but it shouldn't be seventy degrees! No carbonation made the beer overly bad. I spit up the beer when I was drinking it. I am a huge fan of cask and this is the first cask ale I have tried that I could not drink.  Looking at other reviews I can only assume that Rogue is serving an improperly kept and old cask. It tasted like it could have been a good beer if fresh and properly stored. Rogue should spend less time on marketing and more time maintaining the quality of their beer! Rogue should be ashamed for serving this beer this way. Next time I'm in Portland I want to go to the Horse Brass and try a sample of it there to see if there is substantial difference.

S: Nice aroma of bitterness, with a bit of malt thrown in there for balance. T: This is a great-tasting beer. Some caramel malt in the flavor, with a bitter finish. But the bitterness isn't too heavy at all, it's very nice and makes a beer that is actually quite smooth and easy to drink. M: Medium-bodied and quite creamy, with average carbonation.

Glad it wasn't my eye, I expect to see this foaming over, but it sits... waiting. Pours with a few fingers of frothy tan head, a slightly hazy orange-ish amber. Aroma is lemon, grass, earl grey tea. Slightly soured earth. Fairly fruity. Taste was nicely balanced, walking a good line between malt and hops, it followed the aroma. Carbonation was a bit high and fizzy. Overal and nicely balanced brew, though it was a little underpowered for the steak I had with it.",2009-09-19,2679,Younger's Special Bitter

Smells of bright citrus hops with husky lightly toasted malts. Tastes similar to how it smells. Lightly toasted grainy malt flavors up front with good amounts of citrus and lighter amounts of pine hop flavors. The hop flavors fade away right before a solidly bitter ending. As the beer warms the malt flavors intensify and take on a sweeter caramel malt flavor with hints of toffee. Mouthfeel is good. It's got a good thickness with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good. I didn't have a problem finishing my glass and could have a few more. Overall this was one of the better Bitters I remember having, however it's worth noting that all of my favorites have had more hops than are standard for the style. Even without all the hops, the solid malt bill would make Rogue's take on the style worth a shot.",2009-09-15,2679,Younger's Special Bitter

Pours a fairly clear copper with some carbonation visible, and the usual large, tightly bubbled and rocky head that retains excellently and leaves lacing on the glass. Aroma is a nicely subdued sweet floral and citrus hop. I say subdued mostly in comparison to Rogue's usual smack-you-in-the-face hop aroma. Some nice biscuit and butterscotch complement nicely. Hops are a bit more subtle in the taste, and lean more floral. Added in is the noticeable PacMan yeast flavour, some biscuit sweetened with caramel and a grassy bitter finish that's a touch on the sweet side. Mouthfeel is a bit creamy, fairly smooth with just a light bubbling from the carbonation.

3.54,4.0,2.5,3.5,4.0,4.5,"Appearance: Solid three finger thick head that clung to the side of the glass all the way down. A nice golden amber color. Smell: If I was at all disappointed in this beer, which I wasn't, it was with the aroma, which was extremely light. There are some light herbal scents the emanate, but I was hoping for some fruit in the nose. Taste: This beer is clean and crisp. The lower ABV allows for the flavor of the beer to hide the alcohol. The mild to moderate bitter flavor finishes nicely. Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel was light, but not watery. This beer definitely stands up for itself, but isn't trying to pick a fight with anyone. Drinkability: I definitely enjoyed drinking this beer. I enjoyed the moderate bitterness that wasn't trying to punch me in the face. I can definitely see myself enjoying this beer on a hot summer day while relaxing at a cookout or as a session beer.

Nose: Delicate, I was expecting a more aggressive hop smell. Lightly floral. Mouth: Again, as with the nose, I was expecting something more aggressive, more punchy on the hop side. This beer is more like an English bitter then an american bitter. Bitterness is nice. Malt is very present, in fact, more then expected. This make the hops a bit ""hidden"", tempered down. Sweet and fruity on the final. Conclusion, A nice English bitter style of beer. More malty then it's American cousin.

Seeing as how it had been sitting in the fridge for a few days, there was really no apparent reason for its abrupt explosion. I guess that is why they call this one ""Younger's"". After cleaning up the initial disaster, this got poured into a mug. A cloudy amber color results, with some decent frothy head, which evaporates sporadically. What remains laces down the glass. Smell was of some caramel malts. Taste was bitter, obviously, with some floral sweetness. No real excessive carbonation.. potentially used it all up earlier. Leaves the mouth dry with a slightly sour aftertaste. A decent bitter overall.",2009-04-21,2679,Younger's Special Bitter

Loads of lacing as has been the case with most Rogue brews. Can certainly pickup the hop, along with sweet toasted malts. Quite appretizing. Smooth, med-light in body. Nice caramel malt start that gets overwelmed a wee bit by the sharp citrus hop that follows. Bit of butter toffee flavor seeps into the picture after the hop invasion. Citrus rind tends to hang on in the finish for a long time. No hint @ all of the 5.3% ABV. Carbonation is low, as one would expect in an English Bitter, leading to a smooth mouthfeel. Decent attempt, well crafted, but Rogue got a tad carried away with the citrus hop for it to be a top-notch English bitter. If there was an American Bitter then this would score a lot higher.",2009-02-10,2679,Younger's Special Bitter

A bit of sweetness in the nose as well. Taste is mildly bitter upfront with the flavor of bready malt. The hops really make this beer what it is with Williamette and Kent Golding hops.  Smooth and lightly bitter. Has a nice finish from the Kent Golding hops. Easy to drink and reminiscent of a classic English Bitter.  A nice example example of how Americans can make a decent english bitter. The alcohol content is not listed but it feels smooth and easy to drink, which are qualities that you won't see in typical American beers that use a lot of hops or specific hops.",2009-01-31,2679,Younger's Special Bitter

Pale malty sweetness combined with light citrus and a slight floral note. Candied orange comes to mind. Palate: Medium-bodied and much more malty than I anticipated. Slick mouth-feel is then overtaken by hop-sharpness on the finish. Medium-caramel malt notes (like an alt) mingle with the citrus qualities of the hops and a little fruitiness from the yeast, and then are taken by the dry, bitter hops, and a little dried cannabis-like note on the finish. Notes: A slightly off-balance bitter, if only because it seems like it's just an exaggerated recipe. It's both big on the fruity notes and big on the bitter.

The taste is fantastic, and exactly what should be for a special bitter: moderate citrusy-earthy hops (on the cusp of 'too much'), lots of nutty/toasty grains, and some faint caramel sweetness that is overbalanced with a hoppy bitterness.

4.4,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,5.0,"Commercial desription: Tasting Notes:  A classic English-style special bitter, it has a triad of caramel maltiness, frutiness, and hop bitterness in aroma and flavor and a dry, hoppy finish. 7 Ingredients:  Malts: Northwest Harrington, Klages and Crystal 50-60.  Hops: Willamette and Kent Golding. Yeast &amp; Water: Rogue's Pacman Yeast &amp; Free Range Coastal Water.

With a bit too much carbonation and some hops that don't belong, it misses the English Bitter style. That being said this is a terrific beer whatever it is.

On the palate, a dense malt profile really blossoms. All that toasty, caramel like sweetness really pulls through, with a slight dark molasses like touch. The hops are certainly in check. Hop flavor is further relegated to the back and finish of the beer, with floral, slightly spicy tones evident.

It pours a thin head that sinks into a translucent film. It is an amber colored quaff with some clarity. It has notes of lemons and apples - yes, a bitter. I thought it a complex product, especially with three malts (Northwest Harrington, Klages and Crystal), two types of hops (Willamette and Kent Golding) and Rogue's very own yeast strain. [I once dated a girl with her own yeast strain ...] And yet, it is a mild, minimaly hoppy, bitter with a low ABV (4.8) that makes for a smooth sessional. From what I understand, it's usually available on tap or bottle at the Pearl District location. If in Portland, you must... ah, hell. Who am I kidding?

4.03,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"750ml ceramic bottle into nonic. Deep honey amber with a massive 3+ finger light tan head that slowly settles to a very thick cap. Thick sticky lacing along the glass. Very light grainy aromas with a touch of diacetyl. The hops don't really come out much in the aroma for some reason, even toward room temperature.  Although the hops aren't in the aroma, they do show up in the flavor. Sharp and assertive, slightly acerbic, mildly spicy. The malts are toasty and somewhat hidden by the hops. Full bodied with good carbonation. The hops linger for a while.  This isn't an English Bitter, nor is it an ESB. It's closer to an American Pale Ale than anything else. But I guess the goal of this beer is an ""Imperial English Bitter"", which is a bit of an oxymoron, but they somehow pull it off. It's a good beer, hence the score, and it's hard for me to penalize a good beer for being outside of the style boundaries (or in this case, making up a style).

T- Very nice thick mouthfeel to start with notes of caramel, apricot and some like pineapple or pine. The finish on this is slightly oaky, even tough I don't think it's oaked, with a dry mineral finish. Quite nice.  M- Very nice low carbonation and thicker mouthfeel with a great finish.

This beer is perfect for just a refreshing drink on a hot day. Perfect taste, great carbonation and just all around smooth and slightly bitter taste. Drinkability- Just as I expected from Rogue. A great offering and perfect example of the style. I wish I could get this more in my region. I brought this back from Chicago, and it is definitely on the list to get again.",2008-06-03,2679,Younger's Special Bitter

4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"This is basically Rogues contract brew. I've now had it under the ""Fatheads Ale"" and ""Young's Special Bitter"" aliaseses.  I've had this on-tape as well as bottled. It also goes by the alias Fat Head's Ale, which features Pittsburgh beer bar Fat Head's logo.  Amber with orange and a respectable two fingers of head with huge bubbles, almost soapy looking. Nice hops in the aroma, almost IPA in their vigor. Malt is not lacking though, as there is a good balance of caramel roasty backbone to the medium body. Good crisp refreshing mouthfeel. Hops don't have the particular twang of an english bitter, Rogue used american hop varieties in this one in addition to the Kent Goldings, and they really punch through.  Had this ontap at Fat Head's, but i've also had it before under the Rogue label. OVerall a damn fine brew and FH's should be proud to put their logo on this one!",2008-05-19,2679,Younger's Special Bitter
4.52,4.0,4.5,4.5,5.0,4.5,"Poured from a 22oz bomber bottle into a Beligan style wine glass. Appearance- Beer pours a hazy caramel with little to no head to be seen and slight lacing around the sides of the glass.  Smell- Rich and caramelized, not near as hoppy as I was expecting from Rogue and more true to the style. Very impressive nose. Light floral hops. It smells very English and drinkable. Taste- Slightly bitter but still smooth as an English bitter should be. Caramel and biscuity with light floral aspects. Slightly drying on the finish. This is really an excellent example of an English bitter. Mouthfeel- This is where the beer shines most of all, a smooth refreshing mouthfeel with a light bitterness. Medium bodied, low in carbonation, I would love to give this a try on a cask. Drinkability- Extremely drinkable and will be sought out again. I really wasn't expecting this great a beer from Rogue considering that Dead Guy doesn't do much for me and many of thier beers are a bit overhopped. But this was quite a pleasant suprise.",2008-05-10,2679,Younger's Special Bitter
4.3,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,"Pours a clear, medium to dark amber color with plentiful, dense, off-white to tan head. Aromas are very toasty, biscuity, a touch of caramelish toffee, and just a touch of floral hops. On the palate, a dense malt profile really blossoms. All that toasty, caramel like sweetness really pulls through, with a slight dark molasses like touch. The hops are certainly in check with the 35 IBUs barely making a dent. Hop flavor is further relegated to the back and finish of the beer, with floral, slightly spicy tones evident. This malty beast still manages to finish relatively dry and bitter, perhaps a high sulfate water helps. Another solid offering from Rogue, very true to the British examples.",2008-04-16,2679,Younger's Special Bitter

Rich malt taste, with a moderate hop profile. Good, balanced taste but the hops are perhaps a bit to gentle for the style. I enjoy this, but I think it really should have a bigger hop character. Carbonation is nice, not overdone and it really hits the spot. This is a fairly sessionable ale, and as with most Rogue brews, it is well done.",2008-04-13,2679,Younger's Special Bitter

A good nutty slight sweetness in the tail end. Hops subtly tingle throughtout. Finishes dry with a lingering aftertaste that leans toward the hops. This is what I expect a special bitter to be.

In the mouth it leaves a nice bitterness and a tingle.

The taste startsout with a good malt base with a good balance of hop bitterness with citric notes. The mouth feels the sweetness of malt but the kick of bitterness puts things in place quick.

It really is a fine homage to a classical English bitter, emphasis on the bitter, much drier and less citrusy/fruity than the American counterparts. Close my eyes and I could be down the pub.

4.48,5.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,"An excellent bitter. I picked it up in the Fathead's Ale version, from Fatheads in Pittsburgh, in a 22 oz bottle. It poured out great, a wonderful coppery color with a great head, and it had some of the best lacing I've seen from a bottled beer in a long time. Very nice smell, a true bitter, with enough malt to help even it out a bit. Wondeful taste, a nice balance of malts and hops with a slightly bitter side and slightly bitter aftertaste, just like it should have.

3.83,4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,"Thanks to my friend Josh for grabbing this at State Line Liquors for me. It is one of the few currently offered Rogues that I have yet to try. APPEARANCE: Pours into an English pub-style glass a reddish orangish amber. It's fairly opaque and features a one-finger high creamy off-white head. It holds fairly strong and drops to a full surface coating. Lacing cascades down the entire glass in spider web-type sheets. SMELL: The aroma is a huge blast of resinous, floral hops. Searching further, a bready malt base stands out fairly well and serves as a nice balancer. TASTE: It's quite light in flavor with nothing being over the top. The malt base is solid and provides a light sweetness. The hops don't come out as much as I'd expect, but the bitterness is certainly there. There just is hardly any hop flavor to speak of which is a surprise. MOUTHFEEL: Very light bodied with a slightly lower carbonation. Very appropriate for the style. DRINKABILITY: Very VERY easy drinking. I'm so glad this came in a bomber, because 12 oz wouldn't be near enough. The thin body really helps in this regard, but then, that should be expected from an English-style bitter. Excellent. This beer surprised me quite a bit. I thought this would be more like an ""imperial"" version of Brutal Bitter, but it's quite the opposite. I guess I should have done my research. Regardless, I'm glad I got to add this to my ever-growing Rogue collection.",2007-10-27,2679,Younger's Special Bitter

Poured a pleasant brownish-gold into a pint glass, with a good sized foamy off-white head. Aroma was mildly hoppy, more leafy or woodsy than citrusy. Flavour is restrained, but bitter enough to make it interesting and worth drinking a bomber of! Low-to-moderate carbonation (just the way I like it), and a pleasantly full mouthfeel (especially as it warms) just add to the drinkability. A very nice, low-key bitter from Rogue that I'd love to find on tap somewhere and have a few pints.",2007-10-20,2679,Younger's Special Bitter

S: Sweetish fruitiness and floral hops, mostly, with some caramel malts present as well. T: Very much mirrors the smell. Slight hoppiness at first, followed by a creamy fruit/citrus flavor, and a smooth malty finish. Very well-balanced. Almost seems subdued, but if any one flavor was brought out more, it would ruin the balance. M: Slightly watery throughout, but not by too much. Not all that biting for a beer labeled as bitter. D: Really good. This beer is smooth and goes down easy, without sacrificing good taste. Overall, an interesting brew. The taste was quite good for the style.

Great looking beer! Caramel malt covered with citric hops hits my nose, and it seems a bit floral. I've got to inhale pretty deeply to get as much of this nice aroma as I'd like, but it is very pleasant. Taste is again heavily caramel with a bit of a toasty flavor. A little vague sweet fruitiness with a more pronounced bitter citrus. Bittering builds into the slightly drying finish. Full-flavored and very enjoyable. Body slightly thinner than desired, but it is pretty crisp on the palate and easy drinking. Very refreshing, and the bittering is just in check enough to seem quite sessionable.

Body was medium, as was carbonation. Very refreshing and easy to drink. Quite tasty. My preference runs to more hops, but since a bitter is supposed to be balanced, this was well done.

Surprisingly, the froth left spider webbing ridges of lacing all down the glass. The aroma was fragrant, sugary sweet and very fruity. Granny smith apples, pears and sweet caramel malts came through strong. The taste was well balanced, but the malts definitely took center stage. Creamy, biscuity malts came through up front. Caramel malts were also quite noticeable, along with somewhat sweet and fruity notes. The finish was slightly hoppy, providing the needed balance. Mouthfeel was very flat and rather warm (typical of a cask ale) with a slight initial creaminess that disappeared as the beer turned completely flat.

Taste: Earthy, toasted malt flavors upfront with a bit of buttery caramel sweetness. Hops provide a gentle citrusy, spicy finish. Some yeast flavors manage to creep into the finish.

To be honest, I'm probably underrating the aroma since I was in a bar and was bombarded with cigarette smoke/food smells. However, I did get a couple whiffs of the brew and was rather underimpressed. A touch of hops, some fruit, and a slight sweet floral boquet and that was it.  Taste was actually pretty good. A nice hoppy bite that reminded me of some type of leathery varnish (just a mental ""tasting"" image, not a bad thing) and well-balanced, roasted toffee malts to boot.

Off-hints of fruity esters. Toasted malt biscuit with a moderate butterscotch flavor; light cream and vanilla. The floral hop character is pleasantly earthen with some peppery notes. A slightly dark bitterness along with additional notes of honey and cream make for a smooth finish. Medium bodied; a little too creamy and smooth for an English Bitter. The spicy hop character doesn't stand a chance against the diacetyl-filled maltiness. For an English Bitter, the YSB lacks balance and is off the mark in flavor.

The goldings hops assert themselves just after the malt sweetness upfront. Perfect carbonation and a very good medium/light mouthfeel. Finished quite dry. Really a very good english bitter.

4.15,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,"This is a good little beer. Brewing a beer of this type actually requires at least as much skill and craft as the big beers. Dumping triple the hops in the kettle or amping up the alcohol draws attention but too often results in science project beers not really good ones. This is just a very good, basic pub beer. Understated and mellow, it's not intended to bowl anyone over --it's meant to drink. A medium amber with a hint of gold and mostly clear, it forms a nice head that subsides to a 1/2 collar. The smell is mild but redolent of fine malt, caramel and touch of spicy and floral hops. It's a light bodied, lightly carbonated brew meant for an afternoon of sipping and ity tastes so good you will want to sip it all day. Very well balanced with just a hint of roasted malt in the mix, a subdued but tangy yeastiness and restrained but evident floral and spicy hoppiness with maybe a tinge of dry citrus. A session beer par excellence.",2006-08-31,2679,Younger's Special Bitter
4.2,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.5,"22-ounce silkscreened bottle. Ruddied amber with a dense and creamy manilla head. Appealing mellow English hop aromas (EKG); a bit of toasty buttered biscuit as well. Warm rounded malts introduce the taste, with a biscuity character being most prominent. There is an ever-so-slight butteriness to the biscuit flavor, and there are some green plum and other watery fruit flavors -- the character is almost woody. Leafy English hops bring the swallow to a close, and a strikingly sharp mineral finish seals it up. The mouthfeel here is incredibly smooth. Medium body gives it just enough heft. A ridiculously drinkable bitter. I actually much prefer this to Rogue's Brutal Bitter ESB. I'm very glad to have found this at Beers of the World in Rochester, and I hope they continue to stock it.

Appearance- A beautiful rich caramel brown beer was poured *perfectly* by our friendly, accommodating barkeep. Bone white head, just peeking over the surface, great sticky lacing for an ESB from Oregon. Smell- Wow! This is one of those moments... the few, far between instances where I just want to smell this beer the rest of the night. Forget dinner, forget everything... this is amazing. Huge, caramel notes with a sweet, biscuity malt background... think Fuller's ESB cranked up to eleven, with nothing sacrificed, just amplified. Absolutely exceptional. Taste- Sweet, malty, bready, so damn delicious... I've never tried this beer before, even in a bottle, so this is a real treat. The caramel notes come forth on the sides of the tongue and play off the sweetness of the overall beer, then subside with a mild, easy bitterness that quiets the palate for the next sip. Outstanding. Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Slick, buttery, and way too drinkable... this beer was the bomb tonight. Seafoamy effervescence in the mouth was perfect for the big, juicy flavors here.

A bit malty and sweet in the middle and medium dryness on the finish. So far, it is simply good. Not amazing or impressive. Just good. Mouthfeel, I felt, was a little too thin, but it did have a nice level of carbonation. Drinkability, I felt, was decent. All in all, I feel this is simply average.

The Newcastle brand seems to be plastered on an increasing number of beers - rather than bolstering the brand I reckon the effect will be to dilute it. Oh well. Poured into a straight pint glass. A clear golden-amber colour with medium carbonation. Forms a decent head of frothy white foam that lasts for a minute or two before dissipating. Some lacing. Aroma of light grainy malt with hints of faint caramel, husk, mild cardboard, fruity ale yeast and a whiff of stewed leaves. Not much going on. Tastes of grainy malt with a mild finish. Hints of weak caramel, husk, fruity ale yeast, wet cardboard and a hint of stewed leaves. A slightly harsh note in the background, followed by a subtle bitterness upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is dry, smooth and faintly tingly. Carbonation is OK but the body is thin and watery. Somewhat astringent, with an aftertaste of cardboard and stewed vegetables. Meh - a pretty poor effort. Bland and watery, with little depth or character to keep you interested. The Newcastle brand is going to be subject to the law of diminishing returns if it keeps making brews like this.

The malts are rather one dementional, and the hops are not quite English, but this gets by alright. The carbonation is quite sharp for a bitter, and this feels much more like a generic lager than a real bitter, but all the same it come off fairly well and doesn't feel too thin.

I can drink most ""bad"" beers and I would prefer them - and I'm talking Natty Light level - over this. I recommend passing on this. The fact that this got any good reviews makes me wonder if I had a bad batch.",2012-07-17,50670,Newcastle Summer Ale

Hops are also flower petals. Sweetness is pronounced more than anything else, but the bread is quite blatant too. T-Pleasant. Light citrus and floral hops. Bready and doughy. Sweet throughout the entire tasting experience. Finishes with a mild dryness. Clean enough. M-A bit creamy. Milder carbonation with some body behind it as well.

The color was pale orangish brown with very little head. It had no lacing to speak of. It looked refreshing. The smell was brown sugar and lemony. The taste was a tiny bit sweet with a slight hop on the finish. Overall it was right for this 90 degree day. I would buy it again on a hot day.,2012-07-10,50670,Newcastle Summer Ale

Has that skunky yeasty flavor that alot of macro beers like becks and heneiken have. Hops are light and bitter but nothing much. Some light fruits come in at the finish. Mouthfeel - Light, smooth and easy to drink. Tounge mostly gets malts and sugars, palate gets remaing malts and minor hops, and that skunky flavor. Aftertaste is weak and dry. Overall - Hey its better then a bud or miller. It is what it is, a average beer that should be easy to find if your stuck somewhere looking for a beer that actually has some flavor to it.

Reading the back of the bottle label in the store, I noticed no mention of orange peel, coriander, etc. Hum, maybe this is a ""Newcastle Brown Lite""? It pours with a nice-looking color that is between amber and golden. I was getting two-finger head on my pour. Decent lacing at first, head disappears in about 10 minutes. There was some foam laying on top after sitting for 20-25 with a last mouthful of beer. Aroma is ok, reminds me of Boddington's (?). It has a nice citrus-like finish but not in the taste. Feels slightly tangy, a little hoppy but not strong. Light maltiness. It is kind of like a Nut Brown ale light. Seems pleasant enough to drink on a scorching summer day, but not an outstanding beer.

T- clean and malty, carmel and then some cider with a slightly bitter finish.  M- light and even a bit watery. Carbonation is appropriate.

Who knows. But I bought it. Aggressively side poured from the bottle into a tulip. Appearance - Pours a golden, amberish color with a weak sauce one finger head that dissipates rapidly and leaves no lacing at all. Carbonation action can be seen inside the beer. Smell - I noticed the preeminence of buttery, bready malts. The nose was eriously like that of buttered bread or something similar. Unique, to say the least. I liked it. Taste - More buttery bread, a slight hop kick at the end. Just enough to justify being called a bitter, I guess.  Mouthfeel - True to style, carbonation is low, as well as the alcohol being indiscernible. Finished with light bitter hops, light bodied. Overall - I would recommend trying this brew once, just for the sake of trying it. It's not going ot knock your socks off, nothing to write home about, but it is unique and worth a try at least.

S: Smells ""bitter"". No grapefruit. No sourness. No citrus. No mango. Just metallic bitterness. T: Taste follows the nose. Bitter for the sake of being bitter. Mild malt sweetness at the very front. Then a moderate amount of bitterness slowly plods in, overwhelms whatever else might be there, and just remains ""bitter"" all the way to the finish. M: Light and thin. Carbonation is a shade low for my liking. Finishes dry and bitter.  D/O: Life's too short to drink subpar beer. It's not particularly drinkable, and it's not particularly enjoyable. My guess is they're moving cases of this because they called it ""summer ale"", and in the summer time, Common Joe The Beer Drinker gets a little bit more adventurous and will try something new that has the word ""summer"" in it.

Poured it into a glass to find a brownish yellow pour with a white head that developed then disappeared. A small ring stayed on the edge of the glass to the finish.

I get malts, yeast, and floral hops on the nose but there is something else offsetting the whole thing...something akin to ginger. The body is summer seasonal light and creamy. The taste has a kind of cardboard like maltiness with a more notable bitter hop finish that lingers for a moment. There are summer seasonals from other brewers that I find to be more appealing than this one. I think I will stick with their traditional nut brown ale.",2012-06-14,50670,Newcastle Summer Ale
2.96,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,"I picked up a bottle of Newcastle's Summer Ale a couple days ago for $1.59 at The Lager Mill. I wanted to try some summer beers that were new to me and this one caught my eye, so lets see how it goes. No visible bottling date. Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a imperial pint glass. A- The label on this beer looks good. the color really pops and makes this beer a little eye catching. It poured a very clear darker golden yellow color that looked the same when held to the light and it had two and a half fingers worth of fluffy white head that died down to a thin layer that stayed till the end and left some nice rings of lacing. This is a descent looking beer with a nice head. S- The aroma seems to be similar to their Newcastle Ale, it starts off with a good amount of pale malts that have a higher amount of medium sweetness and impart some grainy and bready aromas along with a slight musty and biscuit like aroma. Next comes the hops which are pretty light and only impart a mild grassy aroma. I wasn't impressed with the aroma, its pretty bland and the musty aroma was unwanted. T- The taste seems to be fairly similar to the aroma, it starts off with a large amount of pale malts that have a lower amount of sweetness and impart some grainy, and bready flavors and are followed by a weird herbal taste that might be from the hops. Towards the end I get a light amount of hops that impart a light grassy flavor and gave this beer a lighter amount of bitterness, with a sweet grainy aftertaste. The taste was pretty average and bland, it needed more hops.  M- Somewhat smooth, a little crisp, pretty creamy, on the light side of being medium bodied and it had a nice amount of medium carbonation. The mouthfeel was ok, I didn't mind the creamyness, but I wasn't expecting it. Overall I wasn't impressed with this beer and I thought it was a pretty average example of an English Bitter, I don't have any experience with this style so that might not be that accurate, but I see this beer as average all the way around regardless of style. This beer had ok drinkability, it was somewhat smooth and a little crisp, but the flavors are bland and don't hold my attention, one is enough for me, I wouldn't want another one. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, they were the highlights of this beer and while not the best they didn't have many flaws like the other aspects of this beer. What I liked least about this beer was the aroma and the taste, they were just too bland with not enough hops showing up. I don't think I would buy this beer and I can't say I would really recommend this beer, as far as summer ales go, it's not hard to find a much better one. I have had their Newcastle Ale before but I haven't reviewed it, it's a solid English beer and is a little similar to this beer, but the extra hops that they advertise really don't show up, I wasn't impressed with beer but I still think this brewery is pretty solid, I'll have to try more of their beers, but this one just wasn't for me.",2012-06-14,50670,Newcastle Summer Ale

T- fruitiness up front with a slight citrus and berry character, followed by an odd-ball buttery malt flavor. Minor notes of toffee and fresh toasted grain sweetness struggle for dominance against grassy and earthy hops and kinda reminds me of an American made Scottish ale, namely twisted kilt. Cigarette tobacco flavor, dry hardwood, and some peppery spice from the hops along with spice from the barley that kinda leans toward nutmeg.  MF- crisp ""light"" body, Leveled out artificial feeling carbonation does its job and goes home when the glass is empty. Plenty of residual grainy sweetness and feeling is left behind on the palate resulting in an overall particulate feel that should theoretically take away from the summer refreshment thirst quencher factor but really doesn't. Tea like tannins are also present.  D- this one isn't so bad although it's getting bashed all over the place. If I was blindfolded I wouldn't guess it as a bitter, actually I would be stumped.

It pours smoothly into my snifter and has an average amount of head, lace and foam. It has a typical summer ale aroma of lemon and lager. It is a beautiful color and it is a pretty decent beer. Great for barbeques and backyard swim parties.'",2011-10-09,50670,Newcastle Summer Ale
2.68,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,"Newcastle Brown Ale is a gateway beer for a lot of college kids who end up getting into good beer. However the summer ale...will definitely not. A - Pours pale gold with a water head right into my convenient Newcastle glass. S - The mildest toasted hops are picked up vaguely. There's really not a whole lot going on here. T - Drinks a bit like a traditional English bitter but somehow even thinner. A mild hint of hop bitterness here, a splash of malt and yeast there, but it's mostly just a straight forward beer that's cold on a hot day. M - Thin, not challenging, and follows easy brewing to a T.

Nose is faint, a bit grainy, sugary, with some sweet corn like notes. There isn't much to smell, but what I notice is kind of odd. Taste is like the nose. Sweet, corn like, buttery, with some cereal grain, and mild tartness. Finish is crisp, with faint mineral hops. Weird taste, it's just too sweet and grainy. Mouthfeel is ok, a bit thin and watery though. Overall, this is average at best, but bordering on bad.

Looks like a refreshing summer beer. Smell - Lite toasted biscuits, minerals, slight citrus and grassy, floral hops. These smells are all on the lighter side, not overpowering. Smells light and nice. Taste - More of the same, crispy dry biscuits, some slite malt sweetness, grassy meadowy hops, very lite citrus - and minerals throughout. I wish the flavors were a bit more bold, taste is somewhat watered down. Mouthfeel - Lite mouthfeel, this beer is very crisp and finishes somewhat dry. Overall feels like a lite beer - but still thirst quenching. Overall - A pretty good summer beer. And at 4.4 ABV, and the lighter flavors - this would be a great beer for throwing back a few after mowing the lawn.

The bottle label says “hops and glory” but I really don’t get any evidence of noticeable hop aromas or flavors. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel.

Nothing wrong with that, just typical. Clear and golden, impressive head on top. Buttery nose with some spicy hop presence. Smoothness over crispness in a fluffy light body. Buttery yeast flavor is the main attraction here, with the malt helping to round it out. Hops have a quick kiss of bitterness and spicy flavor. Light bready maltiness peeks through right before the dry finish. The buttery tone eventually chips away at the drinkability; not half bad, but the flavor doesn’t scream summer to us, so perhaps it’s not so typical after all.",2011-07-28,50670,Newcastle Summer Ale
3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,"Picked this beer up via the single bottle at Gary's in Wayne last week. I didn't feel like shelling out for 12 of these and sure enough, my hunch was right. It's been a long time since I had a Newcastle Brown Ale and when I first saw this, I was surprised that these guys finally put a seasonal out. Like most Summer offerings, this one's light, relatively forgettable, and worthy of drinking during those marathon lawnmowing sessions. This beer pour a clear golden hue with a good head and no lacing to be seen. This was an omen as the mouthfeel was quite thin with the floral and grassy notes strong to the point of overkill. This was very earthy and tart and the aftertaste was quite sour. I found it hard to believe that this was an English Bitter since it taste more German than anything else and seemed to have the look, mouthfeel, and taste of a lager. No brightness here as this could have used some lemon zest or citrus to make it easier to enjoy.  Sure, the alcohol was light in this but I don't think that's why people would grab one of these in the Summer. This was nothing like the flagship from Newcastle and the bottle wasn't even clear. The familiar shape is there but that's where the similarities end. Lots of Hefe's and Summer Ales would fit the bill better than this, and unless you're a Newcastle fan, this beer is probably worth passing over.",2011-07-22,50670,Newcastle Summer Ale

Smell: very light malt aroma, somewhat grainy. Not much in the way of hops coming through here. Taste: light, sweet malt with just a hint of tartness. Hops are earthy and complement the citrusy tartness rather well. Flavor is well-balanced but pretty mild, and bitterness is present but relatively low. Decent but not great. Mouthfeel: medium-light body with a decent level of carbonation. Effervescent and refreshing. Overall: this is not a half bad little beer.

Cracker like grain aromas with a thin bit of lemon on the end. Taste follows suit with maybe a touch of honey sweetness up front and a modest bit of bitterness on the back end. I appreciate the different flavor profile that the English hops have to offer, don't get me wrong, I love Cascades, Chinooks and the like, but it is nice to have something that is not over the top with citrus and pine once in a while. Overall this beer goes down pretty easy, but doesn't offer a whole lot of excitement. Basically if I were at a barbecue and the choices were BMC or this, I would jump all over it. On my dollar?

3.14,4.0,2.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,"These folks are smart. They must know that I don't normally drink Newkie Brown, so they introduce a pale summer ale to get my attention. I knew this day would come, and it happened earlier tonight when I split a 6-pack with a friend. On to the beer: The beer has a honey color to it with a clean body and good head retention and healthy lacing. The nose is a little grainy at first, but soon enough there's a little biscuit and faint kiss of hops.  The first half of one bottle was drinkable, but didn't impress me much on taste. It seemed a little plain. As time went by and more Newkie Summmer was consumed, the beer seemed to be more defined. There was a little bready and honey flavor, and a definate, delicate wet smack of hop leaves, which created a vague fruity taste. The beer's lacking of serious off-flavors, which is part of the reason why this beer has some drinkability. It also has a bigger body than expected, especially given its 4.4% ABV. I would say in the middle; not too watery and not too heavy.  The overall score may not impress a whole lot, but it sure beats Newkie Brown from the bottle. For that matter, it's better than many of the large scale commmercial beers out on the market. With so many wonderful (craft) options for a similar price, I wouldn't seek it out, however it would do in a pinch.",2011-07-07,50670,Newcastle Summer Ale

Offers decent retention and lace for the style. Offers an earthy caramel aroma, a bit rusty in fact. Some hops emerge with a bit of warming but have trouble covering up the metallic notes. Still not really negative. Flavor is thin and light with a touch of bitterness emerging only after some exposure. Finish is dry and earthy once again and doesn't offer any real bitterness.

T- It's all here, biscuity malt flavors, floral english hops... just in bare minimal quantities. There's also a slight metallic note that lingers in the background. M- Very carbonated, at least for the style anyway. The carbonation does subside quickly to let you enjoy a generally light bodied thrist quencher. O- Compared to other examples of the style I generally feel it's sub par. However this beer is not without it's merits.

Light malt, leading to bitterness and clearing to light grain sweetness. The bitter is there, and it works. But the brew misses some intensity. Ok but, well, average. Lighter side with good carbonation. Refreshing from this sense. This seemed to remind me of Heineken but without the skunk. The very light sweetness of the malt balanced well with the bitter.

Flavor is light on bitterness with a touch of fruity apple notes and pale malt sweetness a very nice refreshing mass produced beer that strays from mass produced beer. Under 4.4% abv send me this in cans and I will tailgate before the concert or the big game.

Although it should be highly hopped, I don't perceive it in the smell. Kind of a sour smell. Taste and Mouthfeel - very bitter taste, but the hop flavor isn't perceivable. Slight fruitiness or sweetness that comes out in the finish and balances it out a bit. Maybe a bit of a/the diacetyl taste. Texture is actually fairly well-balanced and a bit frothy.

My brother picked up a sixer of this the other day (before the full onslaught of Snow-torious B.I.G. set upon us), so I figured I'd steal a bottle for myself. A little concerned about having a summer ale in the depths of winter, but I can't decipher the ""freshness date"" on the label to ease my mind (or dissuade me from drinking it). Here goes. It pours a clear brass topped by a healthy finger of white froth. The nose comprises coriander, menthol, wheat, and light grapefruit peel. The taste brings more of the same, though the menthol is increased, and there is a strong sense of the white, fleshy part of an orange's peel. The bitterness is a bit in the extreme, to the point of puckering my lips (more like buckling them, like a boxer's fatigued legs). The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda watery feel. Overall, I hope this was just an old batch or something, 'cause it doesn't taste anywhere near good.

They don't blend well together, giving the impression that this is going to be bland and uninteresting tasting. My prediction above was confirmed. Just enough hops for me to wish there were more, some equally uninspired attempts at malty sweetness, plus an unexpected lemony tartness in the backfround that didn't match anything else going on flavor-wise.

You mostly get bitterness from the grain or hops so it even comes off as a sort of a pale ale. It is sweet and grainy and wet. M - Very light. Felt like I was drinking water D - Well summer ales have come and gone and even if this beer hasn't improved with age it really didn't get any worse.

Thin, almost watery flavors of sweet caramel/toffee malt, followed by a low key, Bass Ale-like green apple crispness. Very low bitterness; I couldn't pick out any hop character.

Aroma is grain, bread dough, apple, light buttery caramelised toast, hint of leafy-lemony hops. Taste is light peppery-leafy hops with hints of bitter lemon pulp slightly dominating throughout with light bitterness just dominating over light honey-bready sweetness with hint of buttery caramel. The hop elements and bitterness linger gently in the clean, lean finish and aftertaste. It is pretty good, a decent drinking beer but a bit thin in character and not at all complex. It is on the bitter side and slightly lacking character or malt presence to support this since the hops mostly come through in a bitter bite that has only short hop flavour as noted above.",2010-09-26,50670,Newcastle Summer Ale

It's crisp and simple, but not without it's charms. Again, this is a well-balanced affair. Grainy malt and juicy hops in the finish. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a balanced finish. Drinkability: Top marks here as this was obviously built for sessionability. I just wish I had another bottle to keep the experience going. Verdict: Newcastle Summer Ale is a solid little brew.

Bitterness is slightly higher than the sweet, but not by much. It brings in some black tea and lemon. Finishes with a lingering black tea flavor.

A - Pours a brilliantly clear goldenrod yellow with a pile of dense white foam that reaches three fingers before dropping slowly. Lace is left on most of the glass. S - Very sweet malty caramel and vanilla opens the aroma up with an odd scent. A little toffee and English muffin comes out too. English hops are incredibly mild in the aroma and unfitting, especially with the tag line on the neck band. Too malt-driven and too sweet in aroma for a summer beer. T - The sweetness in the aroma is mostly balanced out in flavor as the English hops pull through more. The vanilla remains on the finish but a slightly buttery aspect enters the picture. It seems a little off. M - Borderline crisp and very smooth, Summer Ale has a tiny bitter hint on the finish overshadowed by vanilla. Lower carbonation feel on the swallow too. D - Easy enough to drink I suppose but slight hints of off flavors aren't encouraging.

Basically it is cheap malt from a BMC lager mixed with plastic and some strange fruit scent. Good overall strength, but that just makes things worse here. It actually does smell like corn at some point. T- I can see how it sort of resembles an English Bitter. The slightly nutty and bready malt is there. There is some bitterness and Euro hop flavor as well, lends some grassy/earthy and fruit flavor. Overall though, the flavors feel sort of artificial, could be added flavoring, who knows. The good flavors fade pretty quickly. MF- Light with a fairly watery body. High carbonation slightly stings the tongue. I wouldn't know what else to expect, a bit soda-esque. DB- This one started out with some characteristics of an English Bitter but went downhill fairly quickly. The more artificial hop and adjunct flavors took over and balance was lost.

2.11,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.5,2.0,"First of all, Newcastle Summer Ale is NOT a hefeweizen. I would guess it is supposed to be an English Pale Mild Ale, but I'm not positive. It certainly Isn't an EPMA, but maybe it was supposed to be? Hard to tell. The beer pours with a dull golden colored body that is completely translucent (and completely filtered). The head looks OK, as it is a little bit creamy and even leaves a spot or two of lacing on my glass. The aroma has hint of English hops, some musty-smelling malt. It also smells like some form of extract was used to brew this. When I asked the bartender what this beer was, his reply was ""it tastes like Iron City,"" if you're not from Iron City territory, that is not a compliment. Sadly, his description was pretty apt. He then gave me half a glass for free, knowing that I wouldn't be happy if I actually had to pay for it. The positive part of Newcastle Summer Ale is that there is a hint of hops (English? The press release claims Fuggles) that add a bit of bitterness to the beer. At least I think there are hops, I could be reaching. The bad part is that the hops are extremely weak, and are overcome by a musty-tasting malt and the obvious use of extracts in the brewing that produces a slightly corny/plastic-like flavor. (I'm not sure that corn was actually used to brew this, but rice or some other form of extract certainly was). Mouthfeel is watery-thin and light. Newcastle Brown Ale is a decent beer, so I was interested to give Newcastle Summer Ale a try. Newcastle Summer Ale, despite its name, is NOT a decent beer. It is on par with an average American Adjunct Lager, and I don't suggest giving it a try.",2010-06-12,50670,Newcastle Summer Ale

The hefe is also missing, there being not one suggestion of sediment in the bottle. Upon tasting it, I would classify it as a British summer ale.  What I did get from the tasting was a pleasant surprise. Whereas there is litte hop presence in NBA there is plenty here, as promised by the information on the packaging. A spicy Fuggles element really comes through. Mouthfeel is substantial and the higher hopping level doesn't affect the strong malt elements here. For NBA they do add corn grits as the adjunct and I suspect some here also (it is alot less noticable in NSA). The ale finshes with a crisp hop finish.

It is a copper color with some clarity and bubbles coming up through glass. Smell: Toasted bready malts, a little chocolate, fruity notes, and a little caramel. Taste: Toasted bready malts, some caramel, chocolate, a little fruity, and some bitterness towards the end. Mouthfeel: Chewy, a little creamy, some bitterness, light to medium bodied, and light to medium carbonation. Overall: Pretty average ESB or amber ale like the label says. It is more true to the bitter style.",2013-11-22,2505,City Steam The Naughty Nurse

T: The taste has flavors of grassy hops and toffee; notes of cough syrup-like flavors become noticeable and linger through the finish. No bitterness is perceptible. M: It feels medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of visible carbonation. O: For being an English Bitter, this beer didn't have much in the way of bitterness.

3.34,3.0,3.25,3.5,3.25,3.25,Large bubbled head that dies down to nothing. No lace. Neutral amber color and nearly clear. More caramel and crystal malt nose than any hop. There's also a notable iron smell. The sip is far more bitter than the smell indicates. The malt base is brief--it's not sweet but it has some elements of caramel and powdered malt. The hop provides bitterness but little complexity. The aftertaste is long. Thin bodied with an elevated level of carbonation.,2013-08-31,2505,City Steam The Naughty Nurse
3.74,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,On tap at the source. Comes to the table a clear amber color with a small head but a decent amount of lace. Smells of light caramel and brown sugar with a earthy spicy hop to provide some balance. The flavor is earth and spicy hop with a hint of skunk and a solid caramel malty backbone. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick sweet mouthfeel. Nice approachable easy drinking ale.,2013-08-18,2505,City Steam The Naughty Nurse
3.26,3.5,3.0,3.25,3.25,3.5,At Wood n Tap for dinner decided to go with a local brew on tap.  Appearance - Initial delivery was a cloudy amber with about an inch of creamy foam in a clean beer glass. Carbonation was light. Let the drink settle for a few minutes and the cloudiness turned to a crystal clear amber.  Smell - Pleasant smell with a hint of burnt caramel and bitter hops.  Taste - Initial sip was pleasant enhanced by notes of toffee and caramel. Bitter but pleasant and balanced after taste remained.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied and drinkable with good carbonation.  Overall - I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and ordered a follow up. Very drinkable english bitter ale.,2013-08-03,2505,City Steam The Naughty Nurse
3.03,3.25,2.75,3.0,3.25,3.25,"A: Naughty Nurse pours a slightly cloudy burnt amber with a decent off-white fizzy head that lends to little lacing. For a ""Naughty Nurse"", her head really doesn't go the distance. S: The nose is pretty tame, exhibiting a little caramel, roasted malts, and hay. I'm picking up some mineral notes as well. T: The flavor is a bit more complex- although, not by much. Nutty caramel, toffee, and roasted malts give way to slightly bitter hops- reminiscent of an English Bitter. This brew starts off kind of like a brown ale, and ends like a bitter. Very nice indeed. The aftertaste is malty and sweet. I'm not detecting any of the ""bite"" that the Brewer alludes to. This is a rather mild, drinkable beer. I don't feel that it's putting any hair on my chest. M: This beer is light to medium weight with medium carbonation. Its drinkable mouthfeel and mellow flavor make this beer dangerously easy (as a naughty nurse should be). This beer will also pair nicely with food. Overall, I think City Steam's Naughty Nurse is nothing spectacular, but, DEFINITELY nothing to reject. This is a fine brewed beer with nice flavor and versatility. Restaurants would be wise to have it on their menu. Personally, I'd find it hard to pass up to accompany a meal or hardy sandwich.",2013-06-24,2505,City Steam The Naughty Nurse

S - Aromas are fairly average, albeit light. Sweet malts and some caramel. The hops are super, super faint. Almost nonexistent. T - Taste is more of the same. More of the same sweet malts, caramel, toffee, finish is earthy and bitter. Not much in the way of hops though. M - Mouthfeel is average, decent enough carbonation.

Sticky lace and thick cap. Smells great with fat malt and light citrus. Lemon and floral are light as a feather on a bread &amp; biscuit caramel malt spine. Malt opens up deep and sweet. Taste is gentle ,clean crystal malt with a good honey and butter sweetness, slightly nutty, alongside hops that are as gentle as a spring breeze with some earth and floral and not quite too bitter. Just enough bitter to lean in on the back palate. It was a touch watery and thin. Drank smooth and bittersweet and had a silky mouthfeel with just a bit of carbonation to tickle the throat. Really good.",2013-06-12,2505,City Steam The Naughty Nurse

3.62,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,"Served on-tap at jm Curley in Boston, MA A: Pours a clear dark reddish amber in color with light amounts of visible carbonation and some garnet red highlights. The beer has a one finger tall frothy off-white head that reduces to a very thin film covering the majority of the suface of the beer and a medium thick ring at the edges of the glass. Light to moderate amounts of lacing are observed. S: Light to moderate aromas of toffee and caramel malts with a light amount of sweetness and light amounts of fruity yeasts. Very light notes of earthy hops. T: Mild amounts of sweetness from the toffee and caramel notes from the malts. There is a light amount of fruitiness from the yeast and some light earthy hop flavors. Light amounts of bitterness that fades pretty quickly. M: Medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. O: I thought this beer was pretty easy to drink and could be sessionable, though I probably was not a big enough fan to have more than a couple of these - I was hoping for a little more grassy/earth hops that I expect for the style.",2013-05-07,2505,City Steam The Naughty Nurse
3.47,3.75,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,"Pours a decent fizzy almost 1 finger head that fades at a med pace, light lacing, semi clear amber cranberry reddish color. Nose sweet malts, reddish candy malts slightly syrupy, some toffee and caramel, sweet juicy malt profile and hints of fruity hops. Taste starts with sweet malts again toffee and caramel as well as plenty of candy malt flavors, when decent sweetness. Reddish toasty amber malts as well. Then light hops, a slight earthy grassy profile that brings mild bitterness, and an earthy dirty bitterness. Finish is drier but a little sweet still, lingering grassy hops and light reddish amber candy malts. Mouth is med bodied, decent carb. Overall meh, this wouldn't be too bad for an underhopped English amber or red ale, but as a bitter this misses the mark but quite a bit. Hops are barely detectable and just a bit of earthy grassy flavors, way too much on the malt side for a bitter even if the hops were bigger, and malts seem too much on the candy caramel sweet side again for a bitter.",2013-05-06,2505,City Steam The Naughty Nurse
3.18,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.25,"A- 12oz bottle poured into a standard goblet. The beer has an amber/dark-red body with an off-white head. The cap on the beer is about one finger in height and takes on a frothy texture. Head retention is decent and a foamy ring ends up depositing just a few tiny spots of lace for me. S- Not a whole ton going on here. Light notes of dark fruit, caramel and some hops make it up for me, really stressing to pick anything up. T- A fairly mild flavor which I sort of expected after my first few sniffs at the aroma. Mild sweetness comes through from the malts as well as some biscuit, caramel and light nutty hints. Spicy/Euro hops are the strongest thing in the taste with notes of grass, herbs and some citrus zest. MF- Fairly silky feel to a mouthfeel with a light overall consistency. Carbonation is moderately high and appropriate for the flavors at hand. Slight bitterness lingers on the palate in the finish. Mild and laid back but not bad, nothing off or abrasive here. Herbal and spicy hop forward with some decent malt backing.",2013-04-24,2505,City Steam The Naughty Nurse
4.06,4.25,4.5,4.0,3.75,3.75,"the first thing you notice is the dark red color. This was tasted in a tulip glass and head retension was decent. the smell was sweet and sugary, some hints of floral in the background. Upon first taste the first thing that you will notice is the Super Lite mouth feel. The next thing you're going to notice is sweetness, a touch of alcohol and some floral notes in the finish.  The light mouthfeel and sweet taste makes you want to have another and finish the glass. This is certainly a session ale, and one has to wonder whether the sweetness is not balanced out with enough bitterness. The bitterness is there its on the palate somewhat similar to a good English ale, but the wet soapy sweet mouth feel craves some balance .  Perhaps balance can be found by paring this with spicy Chinese food or perhaps with dessert. Adding something citrus may be another good idea. I would certainly try this again as it was well above average.",2013-04-21,2505,City Steam The Naughty Nurse

Everything that us there is balanced pretty well. The finish is bitter. Has a nice smooth feel, and an interesting metallic taste.

Nothing fantastic, but it was good. Excellent mouthfeel. No bite, very smooth and mellow. It's got a lot of body, a nice foamy creaminess on a swish, and is an all-around complete beer mouthfeel-wise. Excellent. I was happy with this beer and would gladly try it again.

3.62,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Grabbed a bottle at the Red Door in my home town of Watertown, CT. This amber ale is a deep copper color, clear and fairly quiet. The head is just a thin off-white cover but the lacing is decent. The aroma brings a solid molasses caramel malt that seems promising. The flavor says much the same with more of the distinctive molasses with peachy fruit highlights and a subtle pinch of herbal hop. It’s medium-light bodied with modest carbonation and a slightly chalky feel. It’s not bad, certainly a bit of a statement compared to the average amber ale. But I think it could do with just a little bit more of the molasses power to make this better than simply distinctive. It seems a little watery at times but not enough to ruin it. A different sort of amber and well worth a try.",2011-09-25,2505,City Steam The Naughty Nurse

Smells of pale and crystal malt... Slight spicy hop note. The flavor is pretty dry by the finish, but there was some sweetness up front. The biscuity and toast-like malt character leads into a spicy hop profile.  Medium body, good sturdy carbonation, and a nice bitter bite.  Overall, this isn't a style I would normally go for, but this beer isn't bad. If I were offered one, I would happily drink it.

S: The aroma is very faint but contains caramelized malts, honey and earthy hops. T: The taste starts out with a burst of earthy hops bitterness followed by some breadiness from a hearty but not too heavy malt character.

4.24,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.0,"Ruddles County from Greene King is no longer brewed in Ruddles County, do I care about this fact? Does anyone? Interestingly Greene King produces some other [time to pull out your dictionary] anatopistic brews; Old Speckled Hen, Ridley's Old Bob and Wexford Irish Cream Ale to name a few... again does anyone care? Certainly not I, having never tried the original versions, but it does go to show when brewers merge into bigger brewers sometimes the heart and soul of an ale can be lost to the ages. Poured from a 500ml bottle into a nonic pint. A: Clear safety orange body with a creamy white head that provides a decent lacing. S: Toffee and treacle malt base is upfront with fruity (no doubt Fuggles) hops providing a tea and tobacco leaf background to this classic English Bitter aroma... it's so typical that I'm instantly teleported to a traditional Suffolk pub full of old Brits pint-gulping with plumb English enthusiasm ""Pip pip, jolly good, and God save the Queen"". T: Unsurprisingly it tastes exactly like a classic English Bitter - toffee, treacle, tea and tobacco - the four T's of EB's! Reminiscent of the now-impossible-to-find Pride Of Oxford (by Oxfordshire Ales) this is quite a trip down taste-bud memory lane. There is also a slight hit of bitterness in the finish which is barely noticed in most EB's - also a nice change. M: Mid to light bodied with a flat English pub ale carbonation, par for course here. D: Colour me sepia; the impressed colour. This is really a spot on classic English Bitter, no nonsense here, and at 4.3% ABV it is highly up for a good session. In fact I do (despite my Belgian Tripel and IPA leanings) enjoy a good session ale session, and this ale fits that bill superbly... session [just wanted to get an extra 'session' in there].

A: The bitter is tan-hued and clear, no traces of any imperfections. I was not expecting the thin head to deliver any lace, but lo and behold it did. S: The aromas are malty, chewy with toffee and caramel. Yeast aromas add sweetness and creaminess. T: Toffee flavors rule the ale, with a creamy butter aspect following in short order. Very chewy, the breads stand out even with all of the butter. Hops are earthy, just enough to register. I'll tell you, my memories are fonder; I wasn't as fond of the ale on cask.

Smell is fairly common for the style, malts are up front and pale with a small citrus twist that is LIGHT. A simple nose for a simple style. On first sips or gulps rather I can tell this one is a winner and refreshing. I hope Memphis has this one come back. Taste of pale malts accented with a fairly light hopping giving off slight citrus and earthy flavor. English malts bring this back to perspective and reminds me that this is in fact English all the way. Feel is smooth and light and entirely too easy to drink. I could drinka gallon willingly. Probably my favorite bitter so far, in a style not favored by me. Excellent!!",2011-03-20,1902,Ruddles County
4.16,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,A pulled pint at memphis taproom. Yea!  A- the settles out to a nice two fingers of off white frothy head that holds wonderfully and leaves some spots of lace at first then an epic landslide of think foam grabs hold and slowly cascades down the glass. Bright copper orange in color the shines like a sunset when held to the light.  S- subtle nose with some light caramel and toasted bread. Faint background earthy hops with a touch of fruitiness.  T- toasted bready goodness with a light fruity caramel sweetness and earthy hop finish. So simple yet just right.  M- medium body with that perfect cask carb that just barely shows its head.  O- overall I totally dug this brew. I sucked this pint down like a boss.,2011-03-18,1902,Ruddles County
4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Clear amber pour with a one finger head, decent retention, and great lacing. Very earthy malt nose with a touch of skunkiness. There's no sign of the skunkiness in the taste. It's very unique with a hard to describe kind of vegetable taste with a solid malty base. I'm also getting some tea, caramel and a touch of peppery bitter hops. A fruity sweetness adds nice balance to the bitterness of the hops. Slightly thick mouthfeel but extremely smooth and drinkable. Very unique and surprising!",2011-03-12,1902,Ruddles County

A nice blend of toffee &amp; caramel as well as some hops &amp; a light fruity smell mixed in too. Tastes rather typical for the style with caramel &amp; bread. It has a dry, bitter finish. Smooth and light to medium bodied with a dry finish. Easy to drink too. A pretty average ale overall. It is pleasant &amp; very drinkable as a session ale although it has nothing to make it stand out. Visit: http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com/",2011-01-22,1902,Ruddles County
4.35,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Appearance - deep copper color. Gentle pour produced 1 finger of with frothy/creamy head which had moderate retention and left a fair amount of sticky lace Smell - citrusy hops, followed by pale malt, and some doughy yeast. Taste - begins mellow with some initial malty sweetness and bread-like yeast but transitions into a delightful hoppy bitter finish which is smoothed out by copious amounts of buttery diacetyl. Extremely well balance and complex. This epitomizes english brewing at its finest. I can only imagine what this would be like from the cast. Mouthfeel - light/medium bodied with very low carbonation which I think contributes to its outrageously creamy feel. Drinkability - a low abv style and a low abv beer so this beer is made for drinking in quantity. A truly lovely brew. Its one of those beers that when you open and have your first sip, you sink a little deeper in your chair and instantly feel at home.",2010-12-16,1902,Ruddles County

4.17,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,"I had this on cask at Fountainhead in Chicago. It had a strong toffee &amp; caramel taste and smell, with hops deep in the background to provide some bitterness on the finish. Drinkability was off the charts, I could have put these back all day. English bitters remain some of my favorite beers, especially when they're on cask, and this one did not disappoint. Smooth, rich, buttery goodness.",2010-11-13,1902,Ruddles County

M - Low carbonation. Smooth with a slick finish. D - It's not a bad beer but I just don't enjoy it that much.",2010-11-01,1902,Ruddles County
3.66,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,"The nose was mild - hoppy and floral with crisp, outdoorsy notes reminiscent to a body of water and cool air.  Mouthfeel is very medium bodied and drinkable - easy to drink many of these. Taste is malty, sweet - not overly hopped, and only mildly bitter. It is more malty than any other bitter we've sampled. Overall the flavor is very mild and an excellent ""after work"" beer that can be enjoyed with many kinds of food pairings - we enjoyed it with cheddar bacon fries. Ruddles County is a hallmark example of the bitter style. Out of the bitters we tried, Ruddles County was our favorite, with the 1st show's Arcadia ESB being a close second.

2.59,4.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"I bought this single 5OOml clear glass bottle at Sal's in Addison, IL for $3.99. There was no freshness date on the bottle and their website is useless for finding out anything about the beer. The beer poured a clear copper color with a 1½ finger off-white head that lasted awhile and left lots of nice lacing behind. The beer turns a bright new penny copper color when held to light. The smell certainly is unique, but I can't say I particularly enjoyed it. Heavy doses of butterscotch and toffee mixed with earthy smells and bittering hops. Hard to say what the dominant flavor is. The sweet toffee and butterscotch maltiness competes equally with the grassy and bitter herbal hops. Certainly an interesting mix of flavors, but I'm not crazy about the way they taste together. I like pizza and I like chocolate, but I would never pour chocolate on my pizza. That's how I feel about this beer. I love toffee, I love butterscotch, and I love bitter hops. but I'm not so crazy about bitter toffee and bitter butterscotch. Most reviewers seem to like it though, so be your own judge. This is a medium bodied beer with only moderate carbonation. Bitter aftertaste lingers on for awhile. I couldn't drink more than one of these, nor would I waanr ro go back and pick up some more.",2010-07-26,1902,Ruddles County
4.18,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,"Very good bitter, with a crystal clear appearance and almost without a noticable head. Smooth and almost buttery, with a hint of brown sugar in the aftertaste.

Burgers, steaks, chicken wrapped bacon, ribs, etc. Served a bit warmer than most beers served at a barbeque. Fine by me.  Pours out a copper colour with a nice, thick head that lasted throughout. Very roasted smell with some butterscotch and toffee. Some bittering hops as well. Tasted decent and sweet. Some caramel and butterscotch ruled, with a bit of bittering grassy hops in the foreground. Great session beer at 4.7%, and highly drinkable.",2010-06-26,1902,Ruddles County
4.38,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A crystal clear English bitter with a rich copper look that has a good head, the dry caramel taste is unique and is topped off with a nice Sharpe bitter hop flavor, which goes down smoothly, making this a very drinkable and freshen beer and gives this bitter a decent character. This is one English bitter that is worth trying either in a bottle or a can.",2010-06-20,1902,Ruddles County
4.3,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,"Before I even knew what brewery it was from, I liked it and likened it to the Greene King IPA, which I also lik... uh, enjoy.  Not much head, but a thin creamy layer of it stays right to the bottom. Nice smooth smell. Mellow and rather caramel / butterscotch. Great taste.  Smooth in the mouth, with just enough carbonation.

Some sweet nutty notes up front, with a nice dry toasty bitterness dominating the aroma. Lots of dry malt and a definite English hop presence.  Taste has amazing character for a bitter. That same toasted dry malt presence with just a hint of hops on the back end. Some caramel sweetness balances out the bill. Finishes dry but not overpoweringly so. Mouthfeel is moderate-to-thick, with a heavy-for-the-style dose of hops and moderate carbonation.  Overall this is a pretty great beer. Hard to imagine a better example of the style.

3.9,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,"Clear glass bottle, 1pt .9 fl oz. Poured a clean amber/copper color with a mild white head that leaves some respectable lacing. Smell is somewhat muted to start, although I can detect the hints of bitterness from the hops. Also a slight butterscotch smell. As the beer warms some, these aromas become more pronounced. Taste overall is pleasant. A nice, smooth, easy drinking bitter with some good flavoring/bitterness from the hops. Diacetyl also present here with a slight butterscotch taste to go with the smell. A little hint of fruits are there at the end (apple). Finishes very smooth. A good pick for several rounds with company on a weekend afternoon at the pub or wherever. Be careful not to drink this too cold as it will stifle much of the character.",2010-04-23,1902,Ruddles County
3.86,4.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,"A: light copper in color with a frothy head, Ruddles County is crystal clear. S: caramel, pecans, and a touch of hops are somewhat prese t in this bouquet. T: dry, with caramel and nuts in the front and a touch of hops in the end. M: medium body with little carbonation and a touch of silkiness. D: a well made bitter, and worth a try.

4.09,4.5,3.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,"A: Beautiful clear copper colour, with a tight fluffy head which lasts well and laces the glass. S: Fairly subtle aroma of English hops, a bit overpowered by carbon dioxide - as with many bottle versions this one was probably overcarbonated for the style. T: An archetypical English bitter flavour.Early flavours of hops and crystal malts with a long, intense bitter finish on the back of the tongue. M: Good middleweight mouthfeel - appropriate to its mid-strength alcohol level. D: A very drinkable beer - well balanced and refreshing. At 4.7% the bottle strength is well beyond session level, but sinking a few at home in the evening would be very pleasant.  Overall, the only real criticism is that, like many bottled bitters, its over carbonated for the style - perhaps more appropriate to an American style. Still, a bit of swirling in the glass to remove some of the CO2 does wonders. Otherwise, this is exactly what a traditional English bitter should be; cricket on the village green on a long summer evening in every bottle.",2010-04-01,1902,Ruddles County
3.8,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,"Served at a few degrees over fridge temperature in a pint glass. The only numbers that might indicate a freshness date are GK992791, located at the bottom left of the label. Appearance- Beautifully rich and amber, the color is deep like well-steeped iced tea. The head rises three fingers tall, becoming soapy and compact over several minutes. We see some sporadic, spotty lacing around the perimeter of the glass. Smell- The bold, classic Suffolk nose is clearly evident here, balancing its water's medicinal twinge with a sharp, English hop presence.  Taste- A bready, full flavored ale with a sharp, cutting hop bitterness grips the tongue and arouses the palate. The hard, mineral character from the water source lays the foundation for the IPA-like vicegrip that these hops command. The finish is dry and crisp, with a phenomenal lingering bitterness. My only complaint is that the overall experience is a bit rugged. Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Rolling and active, the beer's texture is quite lively. The carbonation level begins with some muscle, then it smooths out and eases nicely right through to the finish. A nice example of a classic English Bitter, showcasing the hops and water character in a pronounced, assertive beer.",2009-12-15,1902,Ruddles County
4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"This beer has been around for some time, first brewed by the Rutland brewery, then by Morland and now by Greene King subsequentely resulting in a slight change of flavour. The recipe has changed somewhat over the years, originally a 5% brew, then dropped to 4.9% to counter new UK excise duty legislation and now widely available bottled as a 4.7% offering from the present brewer. The beer is made using the distinctive bramling cross hops and pours a nice orange copper with a generous creamy head which is quite impressive. The smell is very pleasant toffee with a buttery, grassy hop. The taste exhibits hints of caramel,faint apple and a long hoppy bitter finish culminating in an almost pungent after taste reminiscent of cough syrup I had as a child. A good,pleasant interesting ale which is certainly worth another try and I can imagine in it's day this ale would have been outstanding. I just think however, it lacks the balance of other ales brewed by the same brewery.",2009-11-16,1902,Ruddles County

A deep rich malt, semi sweet, backed by a nice bitter bite. The mouthfeel is good a nice body and ok carbonation. Drinks a lot like a strong ale. The drinkability is good, I with a fount it on cask.

Its a light brown color (which you can tell from the bottle, as its a clear bottle). Aroma wise, I mostly get the malt, with some woodiness and hoppiness. It tastes pretty much the same as how it smells.  Overall, pretty good but I'm not generally a fan of this style so probably wouldn't have again. Definitely worth a try if English bitters are your thing though.",2009-11-05,1902,Ruddles County
3.06,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,"This is a very traditional interpretation of the style, pretty good if you favor an English Bitter, not so good if you prefer something less traditional. The beer pours a nice amber color, clear, with a smallish creamy head, a touch of lacing. The retention is there if you pour the bottle upside down to force feed the carbonation, because on its own, this beer is pretty flat. The nose and taste are very typical, old fashioned butterscotch toffee, caramel, roasted notes. There is a particularly drying element here with a slightly pungent, almost lemony, mid section and beyond. The aftertaste is the lingering pungence, minus the better parts of this beer. I'm just not sold on the style, and the acerbic stuff in this beer doesn't do it for me.",2009-10-30,1902,Ruddles County

S: Smells of caramelized malts and slight hop aromas. A hint of fruitiness at the very end - that same sweetness many beers from this company have. T: A nice caramelized malt base with some more biscuity malts on top of a nice bitter hop flavor that rounds out the beer. M: Very smooth, somewhat sweet feeling, refreshing, perfect amount of carbonation. D: Very drinkable beer, this is another one I thoroughly enjoyed.",2009-08-31,1902,Ruddles County

Good flavour with nice fruity notes and plenty of hop bitterness. The bitterness is a bit harsh and overpowers the malty sweetness which tries to push itself through. A decent attempt but not the best. Good solid mouthfeel with a crisp medium carbonation level. Refreshing yet substantial.

Bitterness was mild to moderate and the aramel sweetness was balanced nicely, having the same toasted, buttery character that was seen in the aroma. Hop flavour was more lemon and grass than sulfury. It finished with lingering bitterness as the malt faded. Moderate carbonation, medium/light bodied with a bit of dryness and a smooth, nearly coating, texture. Good stuff and an easy drinking bitter.

Sweet malt and brown sugar flavor dominates. The feel medium and smooth. This is very drinkable.

Mouthfeel is full of lingering bitterness and malt sweetness. Not much else. Feels a bit rough. A decent example that loses something from being in a clear bottle.

T- nicely balanced, very dryly toasty up front and not as sweet as the aroma. cereal and whole grain bread. gets pretty bitter mid way with herbal earthy hops being there into the finish and being the last flavor left on the palate. very cut-and-dry, 2 dimensional, and generously hopped. almost bitter like an EIPA.

Rings of spotty lacing along the glass. Lightly toasted malts are in the background, with a slightly spicy bitterness from the hops. A touch of toffee comes in as well. Nice and toasty grains again in the flavor, lending a little bit of caramel. The hops are a bit assertive and bitter, but fitting for the style. Full bodied with good carbonation. The finish is clean, with a bit of hops lingering for a little while. The clear bottle made me a little nervous, but the beer turned out to be pretty good. I think this is a good representation of the style as well. It's a very sessionable beer, that's bitter, without packing a huge punch, which is pretty much what a bitter is.

3.75,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,"Appearance - 4.0 Poured two fingers of foamy beige head over a clear tawny brown body. Smell - 4.0 Strong skunk upon opening (thanks to the clear bottle) which fades but never disappeared. The rest of the aroma is very pleasant though, malty, toffee and leafy hop bitterness. Taste - 3.5 Lots of toffee, caramel and biscuity malt, but it isn't actually that sweet. A moderate to high level of bitterness from the leafy hops, and a very dry finish. Mouthfeel - 3.5 Low to moderate level of carbonation is quite fine, but feels sharpish over the tongue. Weight in the mouth is moderate. Drinkability - 4.0 The bitterness reduces the drinkability for me, but I'd call this beer sessionable, and I would definitely drink it again. OVERALL - 3.75 Given that this is a clear bottled import, the beer may not have been at its freshest, but was still good. Quite raw in its flavour and bitterness, makes many of the Australian brewed bitters seem rather tame.",2008-07-27,1902,Ruddles County

The dry finish has something of a bitterish bite. It has a creamy, medium body. Very smooth. Truly a well-balanced, easy drinking, sessionable English ale. Nice hop touch (taste more than aroma).

Taste - Dominated by grassy hops, with suttle sweetness. The hops are too dominant for a beer that has little other flavour. Mouthfeel - Low carbonation, good texture. Drinkability - A bit challenging. Overall - Apparently this beer tastes like toffee, but it certainly didn't seem that way to me. I'll pass on this one.",2008-07-02,1902,Ruddles County
4.2,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,"Had this beer on cask at The Old Toad, an English Pub in Rochester, NY.  Appearance: Dark amber color with tall foamy head with ultra fine carbonation bubbles. Smell: Sweet malt and fruity aromas. Taste: Toasted sweet malt with a medium hops bitterness. Mouthfeel: Smooth and dry. Drinkability: This was my second beer during this trip to The Old Toad, with my first being Greene King Abbot Ale. While both beers were very drinkable, I actually found the Ruddles County to be a slightly better beer in terms of drinkability.",2008-04-14,1902,Ruddles County
4.24,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Poured from a 16.9 oz. clear glass bottle into a pint glass. A - Looked great in the bottle, looked even nicer in the glass. Bright Copper color with a creamy off-white head, that disperses after a few sips. Scattered lacing. Good carbonation. S - The aroma brought back fond memories. It reminded me of the way New Castle Brown Ale once smelled. Creamy, nutty, malty, with a very slight skunkiness. T - Smooth and creamy and a little nutty up front followed by a hoppy, slightly bitter finish. MF&amp;D - Medium bodied ale. I got the strong feeling on carbonation on the roof of my mouth. Very drinkable, I want more already!",2008-03-26,1902,Ruddles County
4.45,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,"This bitter poured a very clean and clear copper hue with a two finger white-brown head. The smell was soft with subdued notes of malt and hops as well as a bit of citrus. The flavor seemed to have a mixed flavor of hops with a bit of grassy, fruity, and floral characters. It had one of the most complex hop profiles I've tasted, all with a balanced and clean bitterness. The malt body was sturdy and blended well with the hops. The consistency was medium/thick and carbonation was medium. An old school bitter ale that tastes great and has outstanding drinkability. Definately worth it's following. I'm glad that I stumbled upon it and plan on having more in the future. Highly recommended!",2008-03-22,1902,Ruddles County
3.33,4.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,"Poured from the 16oz clear bottle into a standard pint glass. Appearance- Beer pours a light amber with a big three finger fluffy head of cream coloured foam that fades away to creamy foam sticking to the top and sides of the glass. Lacing? It's more glued to the sides really.  Smell- That same grainy balanced pale scent that I remember so well from the can. Even with slightly stopped up senses the earthy noble hops shine through. A touch of fruity hop in the back as well. Taste- Grainy, light fruits, pear, and skunk. I guess the clear bottle isn't near as good in the end result as the can that I praised so highly before. Light and sweet on the tongue still, but the skunk really takes away from an otherwise wonderful beer. Mouthfeel- Light-bodied, well carbonated, slightly sticky, skunky. If it weren't for that cursed skunk, this would be a much smoother beer. Drinkability- More of the same here. I loved the canned version, and will continue my search for that. It looks like the bottle is not the way I will search for more of this. This was the last bottle at the store as well. So much for finding this one again for now.",2008-03-11,1902,Ruddles County

It has potential, I'd love to try the canned version.",2008-03-04,1902,Ruddles County
4.3,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,"Ruddles County (once Ruddles of Rutland, but now it appears to be consolidated with other breweries from different areas) was one of the icons of the CAMRA revolution in the early seventies. I was interested to evaluate it now some twenty years since my last experience. In a clear glass bottle you can see the reasonably dark amber colour; the nose is somewhat fruity, malty; on the palate is where it counts with a very characteristic hoppy, complex, dry, quite bitter, long after taste. There are layers underneath that you don't get in an ordinary beer. Yes, you could still pick it out of a line-up, even with the diversification of bottled craft brews that has occured in recent years.",2008-03-03,1902,Ruddles County
4.3,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,"A clear, dark copper colored beer with a small head that fades into a small ring at the side of the glass. Carbonation is high for the style, at least higher than draft examples. Smell is nice malty with pale malt notes that are light dextrinous and bready. Some caramellic notes and a little sulfur and mineral smell. The yeast adds some fruity, English notes. Taste is mild bitter without real hoppiness. The hops are earthy and low aromatic. The malt is light caramellic and dextrinous. Yeast gives fruity notes. Great balance. Body is quite full for the style.",2008-02-17,1902,Ruddles County
4.33,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,I actually received this in a beer basket of joy for christmas. This was a large bottle which poured a amber color. It had the taste of a mild ale and it had an incredible amount of lacing. Head was good and lasted awhile. Mild mouth feel and no one flavor grabbed my palate. Maybe a touch of malty caramel but nothing standing out in my memory.  All around not a bad beer. I have only very recently started appreciating this form and am still wht some would consider to be a newbie to the style. I very much enjoyed this beer.,2008-02-09,1902,Ruddles County
4.3,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,"Medium orange-red. Head is off-white and persistent; good head retention with this one. Clear body with a lacing that can't be beat. Very nice for the style. I could see it being a little less clear, but that's personal preference. Smells like butter and fruit and metal. The metal isn't so unpleasing, as it is small, but its there nonetheless. Also a sweet, almost pie cruse like aroma. Interesting. Taste is raisins, dried mixed fruit medley, butterscotch and toffee, with a hint of musk. This one was a really cheap four pack, like 4.99 for 1 pint 4 oz. cans x4, without nitro widgets which makes me happy. Hops are English and bready, and balance well. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, though not as creamy as some others of the same style that I've had. Still, without a nitro widget, it holds its own. Highly drinkable, especially for the price.",2008-01-31,1902,Ruddles County

A = Light coppery amber, very good clarity, lots of carbonation bubbles both medium and small, formed a large head on pour made of of many different sized bubbles. Head slowly dissipated but left lacing and never lost its head entirely. S = Great smells form the hops hit first, but on second and third smells I can clearly discern the malt in a slightly sweet smell of wet hay also get hints of spices almost like it is a winter warmer. Very interesting smells. T = Taste does not quite live up to the smell, but it is good. The bitterness factor is perfect throughout and well balanced with sweet malt flavors that make their presence known mid-palate. Finish is long and bitter mostly in the middle of the tongue. M = Medium bodied, good mouthcoating, carbonation is at a good level. D = Highly drinkable. A good bitter at any time and sure fire bet for session drinking.",2008-01-19,1902,Ruddles County
3.45,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,"Quirky brew, the aroma is very different with the toffee, caramel and biscuit malt. Quite the hoppy bitter from England. Semi -dry finish, but with a lingering veggie taste. Poured from the clear, yeah clear, 500ml bottle a clear amber brown, with a wimpy white head. Not a bad $3ish pint o brew, worth a try down the road.",2007-12-28,1902,Ruddles County
3.65,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer was sampled from a 50 cl bottle that I bought at the local grocery store. It's a good-looking beer, rich brown-amber in color, mostly clear, and with a frothy off-white head. The aroma is great. Most notable is a generous smell of fuggles. It's like sniffing a bag of hop pellets. Behind the hops is a slight biscuit, toast, and modest malt aroma. The taste is medium-dry, with a nice balance between malt flavor and hops. Nice bitterness. There's some toffee, and a little caramel in there as well. Medium body, and medium-low carbonation. This is a nice, pleasant, flavorful drinking beer. Much better than I expected. Also, despite the clear bottle, there's little sign of age in the one I tried.",2007-10-07,1902,Ruddles County

3.23,4.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,"When I was a tidler, I used to love this beer on draught, brewed in the tiny county of Rutland. ""Get puddled on Ruddles"" was my moto whenever I came across it. Times move on, now I am a big fish and the brewery I talk of has been flushed away. This beer is now made in Suffolk by the bad boys of English brewing, Greed King, not that the labelling would let you know that. This clear 500ml bottle was drank in May 2007. Poured into a pint sleeve glass a large slighty off white head sat on top of a clear terracotta orange body which had bubbles roaring up to join the head. Hops, toffee and caramel, a sweet aroma for an English bitter. The taste wasn't so sweet, but as the beer warms it sweetens, some toffee remained from the aroma, the caramel tasted burnt and a dryness adds to the proper bitter flavours you would expect from such a style. A metalic tone appears after the fluid has left, which I didn't like. Pity about the mouthfeel, it ruined the drink for me, I will not be having a bottle again, but will try a cask pint if I see one on my travels.",2007-05-17,1902,Ruddles County
3.98,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,"Consumed about five weeks after it arrived in my local store. Pours a light, tea-like orange with a respectable but shortlived head. Smells of light skunking along with a few small spikes of spicy UK hops.  Taste starts with a mild, pleasant skunkiness, leading into heavy fuggles and light grain and ending on a bittersweet finish of light, bready barley and a surprisingly pleasant pasteurized taste.  Nice session beer, but like like so many others from the UK I can't help but feel that it'd probably be a lot more enjoyable fresh. Still, it doesn't fall into any of the traps that your average imported ESB does, and for that I give it a fairly high mark.",2007-05-08,1902,Ruddles County

1.94,3.5,2.0,2.0,1.5,1.5,"Pours from can, slight head. A golden brown ('honey' brown) in colour. Lots of bubbles, considerable clarity. Not much aroma, certainly no hops. Some bready malt is about it. A very unique, albeit odd, taste. Some Belgian like character yeast, over coating a toffee malt body. Fair bit of English hops in the flavour, Fuggles mostly. The flavours evolved as it warmed to something reminiscent of a bad, cheap red wine. Awful. An off putting texture -watery, not quite creamy, not quite crisp - just uneven. Also leaves a stale, cardboardy aftertaste.  HOW does this have a shelf life of 18 months??? Of all the many styles of the world I'm sure these kind of English beers are absolutely among the worst affected by being put in cans. WHY? It kills the body, nulls the flavours and counters all the quintessentials of the style. The can does NO good for these kind of beers, and this is one of many I've tried lately that I could see being quite nice if it were alive, if it were fresh, if it were hand pumped from the source... but as it is here in front of me, this is nothing but sub-par. Very sub-par. A sad case.",2007-02-11,1902,Ruddles County

Appearance: Slightly hazy copper colored pour with a minimal white head. Lacing rings the glass and retains well. Flavor: Earthy moderate hop bitterness up front. A slighty spicy bitterness that asserts itself as the beer warms. Low to no fruity flavors that were expected given the aroma. Mouthfeel: Medium to light bodied with low carbonation. A long, lingering, and dry finish. Overall impression: Strongly slanted towards the English hop bitterness which detracts somewhat from the overall sessionability. The haze suggests a clarity or handling problem. Not my cup of tea but nothing too offensive.

3.86,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,"The beginning of English beer night and a Ruddles bitter packaged in a pretty clear bottle that I purchased with some trepidation, knowing that such a well-hopped brew could be skunked. I crack open the bottle and get a whiff of skunk that dissipates as the pint is left to sit on the counter and warm up a bit; not too disappointing.  The first sip is quite smooth with a some tasty caramel malt flavors paving the way for spicy hops, followed by more (bitter) hops and a long bitter finish -- quite bitter, actually. The bottle says this ale is brewed with ""mineral water"" and this becomes rather obvious as the beer warms up. The minerals seem to add almost salty, slate-like flavor that seems to play nicely with the hops, adding complexity to this brew. This remarkably clear ale looks good, too, with an off-white head that leaves some lacework. Overall, Ruddles is good bitter stuff.",2006-12-31,1902,Ruddles County

Notes: Pours a copper-amber colour with a nice head. Steady retention and bubbles form around the glass. Good strong aromas of molasses, maple syrup, and hop. Taste is nice and powerful. Some fruit mixed in with some caramel. The bold bitterness of the hop kicks in a notch more in the finish and smooth out in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is creamy.

Leafy hops, with some light citrus in the beginning. There is a rather raw earthiness to this that has me interested. A touch buttery and then becomes earthy once again. Hops go from leafy to grassy and back again to leafy. Extremely soft mouthfeel. That English cask type body is evident although I'm sure even more so direct from the cask. Probably the most complex brew I've had in this style. Let this one roll around the palate for a bit and you can really pick up the depth of this offering.  Notes: I thought it was ok overall.

Very earthy aroma; must, hops, green fruit and a farmhouse bouqet.  The flavor is green apple, leather, English hops and biscuits. Very sweet up front, balancing with a subtle bitter finish. This English Bitter drank almost like a Lambic. Served warm, as a cask should be served, I found a myriad of flavor notes throughout; vanilla, caramel, legume to name a few... Very nice mouthfeel, well carbonated, medium-bodied and divinely creamy.  This is a unique and drinkable cask brew.",2006-10-26,1902,Ruddles County

Slightly spicy smelling with prominent tobacco and leather aromas. Slight fruitiness but it is really buried by the hops. Taste is very neutral flavor malt wise and good tobacco flavor from the hops. Bitterness is good and in proportion to the malt level. Slightly fruity but this one is all about the fuggles. Good mouthfeel. Super drinkable and the best beer out of a can I have tried from England yet. Mild and honest to god tasty. Superior to Boddingtons in every way.

3.51,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,"Presentation: Clear glass 500ml bottle sealed with a crown cap. Neck label has the words Imported from England in gold text against a dark green background. Oval front label has a picture of tree set into the words Ruddles County. Below this a separate label states Brewed by Ruddles Brewing, Bury St.Edmonds, Suffolk, England.haha, for Ruddles Brewing read Greene King.Listed at 4.7% ABV. No freshness date but an inkjet code on the neck is L5333 22:51 THK C if that means anything to anyone. Appearance: Mid brown body with a lovely looking off-white head that remains at least ½ thick throughout the drink. Supreme lucidity with an impressive level of conditioning which helps the stunning presentation and great looks. I have to say that this could have been freshly pulled out of a Beer Engine in the North of England minutes ago such is its luster. Nose: Honey malts with a feint trace of mint and toffee. Toasted malts and light hop character. Taste: Nutty feel with a gentle bitterness which is braced by the malts and lends some body. Grassy hints, rich depth though, malty feel with a very distinct hop bitterness that is English in style, as indeed is the feint of buttery diacteyl, but not to any immediately annoying level. A reasonably good effort all round. Mouthfeel: The conditioning is very good and it helps this brew immensely. Soft and distinctly easy going, the texture is smooth and fills out the peaks and troughs to form a freshly laid tarmac road that is an easy drive. Drinkability: Despite the clear glass bottle this sample seems to have fared quite well, no signs of any exposure to light or heat and to be fair a decent enough drink. Quaffable stuff! Overall: I first drank Ruddles County drank way back in the mid to late 80s. At that time you had to travel to the South of England to sample its delights. It was a strong Cask Ale that had a great, often legendary, following at that time.

No fruity esthers present. Good balance between hop and malt flavors.  MF: Medium-light body. Moderately carbonated for a bitter probably due to the fact that beer was poured from a bottle.

I'm rewarded with a one finger head, along with a nice cascade effect (this is NOT nitro). The head quickly disperses into a nice thin layer of light tan foam, leaving thick lacing. Held up to a light, the body is a bright copper. The aroma is quite distinctive, and apparent from the moment I cracked the bottle. It has a musty, biscuity English smell to it, and a rich, potent hop presence, as well. Tasting while admittedly still too cold, I find a mild, slightly fruity, very satisfying taste. It has notes of caramel, toffee. The hops don't show too much in flavor, but they do in a slight, but growing bitterness. Not very sweet - just balanced. Medium body and low carb make it very smooth.

The smell was mild but was nice and sweet. The taste is that of malt sweetness and a welcome hops bitterness at the end, very well balanced. The mouthfeel is smooth, and due to the lack of carbonation it goes down well.

These are truly bitter, attacking, but not overwhelming, the taste buds in the rear of the tongue. This is a light-bodied brew, though it never tastes completely watery (again, I believe due to the hops.) This is a sessionable beer. A bit pricey for the ABV.

Dark reddish color and little carbonation, lacing, or head. Hops and yeast are the main flavors in the nose. So far this seems like I should be drinking it in an old pub in Ely or Ipswich. Taste is initially strong, with full naked hop bitterness and a creamy texture. Mouthfeel is clean and finish is clean.

The aroma is metallic to say the least. Like, very metallic, we're talking early Metallica up to the And Justice For All . . . album. Not much beyond that.  The taste has a metallic bitterness, but isn't really what you come to think of when thinking ESB or English Bitter. It doesn't seem to derive from the hopping. Other than that, it is essentially slightly watery and thin. Its like, without the metallic aspect, this could be a cream ale for all I can tell. The color made me think this might have more of a malt body.  I dunno, there just doesn't seem to be much going on with this beer. What is there is relatively bland, and when it goes beyond bland, it isn't a desirable flavor (metallic bitterness).",2018-09-19,917,Foster's Special Bitter

The aroma, as expected, is pretty light and altogether unexceptional. Tangy fruit esters, grainy dryness and mineral make up the nose, while the flavor is marred by something not quite vegetal and the mineral aspect taken to metallic proportions.

The head was more ale than lager-like, with better retention that usual along with some nice lace and more depth of color that flat white.  The nose is lager-like. This is clean, with saltine, pils malt, and green leafy hop.  This is definitely more full flavored than any other macro lager I can recall. A tiny bit of caramel mixes with dry pils malt and leafy hop with a small bit of noble spice for a beer that is good for an adjunct lager.

Nothing to outright hate about this so much as that there's not much to like...it seems to be trying to tread on its Aussie name/roots (it's brewed in TX now) to attract buyers with the promise of a refined brew, but it's really a caramel-color-added (admitted on the label) high ABV item. First taste and aroma have a rotgut, alcohol-enhanced edge, and -- owing to the added color --the mouthfeel doesn't jibe with the appearance, so the whole thing just ends up feeling like a budget get-me-drunk-quick quaff.

Pours out a bright and clear copper color. Carmel color was added, according to the can. Due to the clumsy can, I had to pour fast, so a large head resulted. It didn't last for too long, but it did leave some lacing behind. Several visible carbonation streams.  This smells pretty rank. Like how low quality lagers smell, but more potent. It has a very musty, stale aroma of grain husks. Sour apple hints are about the best thing I can find. I will leave open the possibility that some things smell worse, so I will spare this the lowest rating.  The taste is not as spirit crushing, but I didn't find much enjoyment here. Metallic flavors sully the whole thing. There's the same musty grain quality in the malt as in the aroma. Very mild toasty flavors, but mostly butter (diacetyl). The hop profile seems about right for a bitter. It's got a little piney kick, and herbal notes. The finish is not all that bad, with a medium level of dryness and bitterness. If the metallic flavors and nasty grains were not so rough, this could have been a decent effort.  Slick, and on the light side. Low carbonation. No problems here.  Drinkability scores low for me, since I physically had a hard time pouring and drinking this beer. I'm sure I lost a couple ounces while pouring over the sink. And as stated above, there's little to like about it. The aftertaste was actually okay enough for me to get through the whole thing. I will be avoiding this one from now on.

Very drinkable, and with only 3.5 ABV this huge ass can equals a normal session beer.

1.41,2.5,1.5,1.0,2.0,1.5,"Regular Foster's is by no means my favorite beer, but I'll drink it if it's a choice between that and a standard macrobrew like Miller Lite or Bud Lite. That being the case, I was kind of excited to give this a try. I've often found that the lesser known brews from larger brewers are a little better quality and decided to pick a can of this up to try. Wrong choice. Upon opening the can, the first thing I noticed was the terrible smell. I knew it was going to be awful the second the seal broke. My fears were confirmed on the first sip. It's bitter (not in a good way), strong smelling (not in a good way), feels gunky and slimey in your mouth, and is an all around unpleasant experience. Admittedly I didn't bother to pour it from the can into a glass in order to improve the experience, but I really don't think that would have helped much. If you are stuck drinking this for some reason (I pity you!), drink it with a block of sharp cheddar cheese. That by no means made it good - but it made it drinkable. On its own, this is an awful, skunky, nigh undrinkable brew. Avoid.",2008-03-13,917,Foster's Special Bitter

Very light, watery flavor on par with many light beers, and more metal in this than Ozzfest. Very strong foil smell and watery metal flavor didn't do it for me.

2.81,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.5,3.5,"Well, I went to the bottle shop to pickup a few brews for the evening and saw Foster's Special Bitter in the cooler. With its big green can (oil can) just screaming for me to buy it, I figured I'd give it a chance.  Poured out of a 20-odd ounce ""oil can"" into a glass. Look: Light amber in color with a bubbly head that quickly dissipated into a light covering over-top the beer. Smell: A little bit of hop aroma lingers in the nose but that lasts only for a moment. Taste: After the Special Bitter is taken in the taste of malt comes in at the front, while a little bit (just a hint) of bitterness hits the taste buds towards the end.  Mouthfeel: Lightly carbonated and light all together. Drinkability: The 'slightly' bitter taste makes this one easy (although not incredibly flavorful) to take down. Therefore I could see myself being able to drink a bit of this over a period of time. Overall the Special Bitter wasn't really bad. In fact, I kind of liked it; it's quite drinkable if one might be looking for something to have over a prolonged period of time.

A very mild bitter if you can call it that. Slightly more flavor than the typical macro. A light body and low carbonation leaves a surprising creamy mouthfeel.

2.7,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,"My Foster's Special Bitter came in a can, but not a dinky 12 oz. can, instead it was one of those big ass 25.4 fl oz/ 1 pint 9.4 fl oz cans. Nothing special about the can. It had a silver and yellow oval with the name of the beersurrounding the big Foster's ""F."" On the side it had the barcode, US Government warning, and who brewed it. If you can find it, there's a number code stamped along the bottom ring of the can. Is it a best before date or when it was brewed date? Your guess is as good as mine. Whatever it means, it has no use to the consumer. Appearance: When poured into a Bell's Brewery pint glass, this Foster's was a clear copper/amber hue with a half an inch off white colored foamy head of foam. This foamy head quickly disappeared like it had somewhere to run to. When it disappeared, it did however left a few small white rings and just a few white spots of lace in its tracks. Smell: For something with the word bitter written all over the can, it wasn't bitter at all. It did have a slight floral hop aroma to it, but nothing that screamed bitter, bitter, bitter! Other than the slight aroma of floral hops, there just a hint of toasted malt and apricot in the background. Taste: I'm going to repeat myself by saying again that for something that has the word bitter alll over the can, it wasn't that bitter at all. Even when the beer really warms up, the only things that were in this beer were crisp dried floral hops, a touch of toasted malt, and a a slice of juicy fruits. That's all folks for the taste! Maybe if you put it in the microwave to really warm it up, more flavors will come out. Actually, I doubt any more flavors can come out of this beer. Mouthfeel: This beer landed some where in between light and medium bodied, but closer to the light side than the medium bodied side. The aftertaste would have been fine if they didn't water down the crispy dried floral hops and the toasted malt. Drinkability: I guess you could make this some kind of a session ale, but I wouldn't do that.

I may be dreaming but I also detected a recessive odor of hops and an indistinguishable sweetness.  T: I was pleasantly surprised given the aroma I expected a much less enjoyable taste experience. There is an initial sweetness reminiscent of an ale, followed by a muted bitter flavor.  M: There is an unexpected creaminess to this moderately light bodied brew. There is a smoothness followed by a slightly bitter bite that quickly disappears. A relatively clean aftertaste..

The taste is very watery with a slightly off bitter taste that borders on rancid. Mouthfeel follows with a thin and nearly non carbonated texture.

The taste is a sweetish, slightly toasted malt, followed by a very small possibly corny, but not bad aftertaste. The malt does shine thru and does lend a goodness to the taste. The mouthfeel is slightly watery and light on the carbonation but not bad. Overall, as in the style of an English Bitter, this ale is close but comes up a little short but not much. It's better than a Labatt Canadien Ale, Molson Export or any other Macro offering. If you want an English bitter get yourself a fuller's ESB. But as a swilling lawnmower beer this beer excels!

I haven't had enough English Bitters to say how it measures up but it blows other beers in its price range out of the water and I've been a fan of this brew for a while.",2006-11-07,917,Foster's Special Bitter
3.26,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,"After purchasing and enjoying a Foster's Lager during a recent dinner I decided to try Foster's Special Bitter on a whim. I was not disappointed.  The appearance, in my opionion, is truly gorgeous. This beer pours a deep, full reddish color and the head sticks around for a while. I was immediately interested. The taste was reminiscent of a standard pale ale, as was the bitterness. While the beer is marketed as ""bitter"" I didn't notice any extra abnormal amount of bitter taste. The flavors were well balanced, however, and together the flavors create a very drinkable and enjoyable beer.  While I can't say that anything was particularly outstanding about this beer besides the color, I can very confidently recommend it to any beer drinker as a fine choice.",2006-10-10,917,Foster's Special Bitter

As it warms, the alcohol is noticeable even though it's only 3.5% ABV. The flavor is fairly sweet and nutty with the grainy malt being taken over by a metallic note that slightly gives a bitterness, then on to dry the finish. It's more like a pils than a bitter, in my book. Medium in body with a smooth, slick mouthfeel and a rather low alcohol content make it easy to drink, but nothing exciting.

She pours a clear copper with a decent white head, fairly pillowy, with decent lace. The aroma... my god... is pretty awful. Smells like your basic American Macro at about 70 degrees, plus a nice helping of metal. On the palate, this beer seems almost as close to a dumbed-down Helles as a Bitter, much less a Special Bitter. True, there seems to be some malt lurking around there somewhere, and some bitterness taboot, but it totally lacks any of the fermentation characteristics of a true Bitter. Not that this surprises me, coming from Foster's...  I bought this because a) it was $2 for a 25 oz can at the grocery store, and b) I'd never heard of it. As much as this beer lacks character overall, and stylistic accuracy in particular, its flavor is at least not miserable, but the aroma is just that.

Poured amber with a foamy white head that slowly descended, leaving a well-retained lace. In the smell, there were hints of caramel and floral hops. The taste was vaguely of a thin caramel touch, but was overwhelmed by a buttery, metallic taste. There was not much else to it, except, at a stretch - perhaps some hop bitterness. It left a bitter, somewhat metallic taste in the mouth. But, it was all washed away by the water that was in it. This is not a good example of an English Bitter, and not even a good beer.

No head to speak of and lacing isn't something one would expect.  Smells like nothing special whatsoever; pretty much smells like Foster's, or other mass produced brews. Taste is lightly bitter and inoffensive; quite like lightly sweetened Lipton tea or something to that effect. Dry and pretty crisp, though it could stand to be a bit more so. It's hard to ask for something milder than 3.5%. Definately a pretty full flavor given the alcohol percentage. This'll do in a pinch.

The head is not particularly sticky, and does not adhere much to the side of the glass.  The smell is sharp with a little bitter aroma. It smells a little bit like wet paint, in a pleasant sort of way. The taste is a bit musty and bitter of course. There is a minor malt presence, but bitter hops carry the day. There is a moderate to heavy and bitter aftertaste. The mouth feel is thin and moderately carbonated. The aftertaste is fairly heavy and makes the beer feel heavier than it is.

Seriously though, a slight slight doughy taste, with the tiniest hints of typical beer ingredients. The low alcohol content of this beer also did it no favors. This is basically a typical non-BA beer that someone would order in lieu of say, a AB product. I really can't comment much more than that on the flavor. On the plus side, it did go down much in the way a bottle of Evian might....which is sometimes maybe a good thing, dunno.

The nose is less promising, with a corny or grainy character all over a mostly hidden malt base, with sugars and caramel also in the mix.  A big slug reveals a little bit of hop action followed by a creamy smoothness and a very palatable hoppy finish. The aftertaste is dry but gets astringent and pasty before long.

Actually quite a smooth taste. Almost creamy. The flavor seems to be made up almost entirely of malts. Not really any hop presence in the taste at all. A slight yeasty aftertaste. Boring but not bad tasting. Easy to drink. The mouthfeel is very smooth. I think they could have amped up the abv a little. 3.5% is terrible. The drinkability is fine, it goes down real easy.

Nose was muted and clean. Surprising taste. Fresh at the beginning, a little bit like a NO tap at the end. Mellow hop, classic English profile. Well done considering the price.

The aroma was straight macro though: I got lots of grains and a hint of fruitness. The flavor was sweet. Overly so for my tastes. There's a hoppy bitterness there along with it, and also a metallic flavor that is on the too strong side as well.

3.06,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,"Rustic orange-bronze with a fine dusting of particulates; much darker than expected and anything but 'fizzy and yellow'. The head is a surprise as well, at least in comparison to my memory of the dreadful Foster's Lager. The cream colored cap achieved three fingers on the pour and has barely fallen in the several minutes since. It has a gently chiseled look and is depositing a fair amount of lace in sudsy shards. While this beer won't win any beauty contests, it's actually pretty nice to look at. There isn't much to crow about with regard to the nose, especially when compared to a true English bitter. It slightly sour and grainy with an undercurrent of fruitiness that must be hop-related. I don't mind putting my nose over the glass, so smelling as I drink should be no problem. Foster's Special Bitter is actually pretty drinkable beer; which makes me wonder what the hell went wrong with the lager. Again, comparisons to the world's best bitters would be laughable, but I'm pleasantly surprised by this Aussie (excuse me, Canuck) brew. Toasted grain is barely offset by a weakly bitter fruitness. Whether that fruitiness is due to ale yeast or hops, I couldn't say. The finish is on the brief side with a touch more bitterness than what came before. The mouthfeel is light-medium and is in no danger of degrading into wateriness. A well-contained carbonation keeps things humming along without entering the realm of fizziness. Foster's Special Bitter isn't special and it isn't all that bitter. As I've pointed out numerous times, however, it's a much better beer than its better known brother in blue, Foster's Lager. I don't believe my judgment has been clouded by the fact that this beer has exceeded my expectations by a country mile (and the 3.5% ABV assures that I've kept my wits about me), but it isn't a bad choice at all.

3.89,4.5,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,"Served this one at fridge temperature in a pint glass from one of those famous Foster's Oil Cans. A - Straight, clear bright copper color. Rocky, marshmallowy dense head. Sticky, clingy lacing that persists throughout the pint. Excellent! S - Notes of European hops. Slight sweetness, with a bit of metallic character. Decent, but slightly underwhelming. T - In the front, you get some light sweet hoppiness (and a hint of metal) along with the beginnings of what become a round, bready maltiness in the middle. The finish brings a tinge of hops without being drying. The balance of malt and hops is excellent. Has some of the character of a true bitter, even though it's technically a lager (more about this below). M - Initally a bit thin and watery, but comes alive nicely in the mouth. Washes down the throat smoothly. The carbonation on this one is completely under control. D - Given the easy character and the nice mouthfeel, this one is very drinkable as a session beer. Now, here are some other things I discovered about this enigmatic brew. First off, the can clearly states that this is an ale, which would justify it being called a bitter. However, I came across a listing of Australian light beers (http://www.melbournepubs.com/docs/beer-light/) with ""tasting notes as published by the brewery"" which states: ""While using the same malt, hops and yeast strain of its famous parent, Foster's Special Bitter contains two special additional ingredients. Extra aroma hops are added to provide a unique flora/estery aroma to the beer, and caramel malt is added to provide a rich golden colour and strong malty flavour. These produce a full-flavoured and bodied bitter with just over half the alcohol strength of full strength beers."" This statement is odd for two reasons. First, if it uses the same yeast strain as Foster's Lager, then this beer is also by definition a lager. And since a bitter is a style of ale, then this obviously can't be an ale. So what's the word ""ale"" doing on the can? Decent taste aside, this truly is one odd brew.",2005-07-06,917,Foster's Special Bitter
4.01,4.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,"What a great, delicious looking brew for a light lager. Served in a pint glass at fridge temperature.  Appearance- Rocky, marshmallowy head with awesome stickiness. Radiant copper. Structure is terrific for the style. Smell- Hops and malts nicely balanced... reminiscent of a Czech pils with a Saaz-like character. All signs point towards a ""bitter"" beer style rather that a ""light lager""... besides, the can clearly states that this is an ale... hmm.... Taste- Slightly metallic, easy hop tinge which then is overcome by clean, bready malts. Finishes with a nice euro-hop bitterness and some yeast. Far more interesting than most of our mass produced American counterparts. Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Thin at first, changing to a smooth, more effervescent quality. Alcohol is nowhere to be found, therefore drinkability is outstanding. This comes highly recommended for the floating beer cooler in the pool, when you don't want bottles around. Pleasantly surprised .",2005-07-05,917,Foster's Special Bitter
2.96,3.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.5,"A deep gold color brew with a highly charged uneven head. Looks promising. The aroma? I had a strange flashback here. They say deepest memories are lodged in smell. I was hit by a flashback to my youth- this smelled like an American macro back when I thought that meant beer. Somewhere in my late teens. Anyhow, you can't go home again- feint hops here and an odd papery smell close it out. Taste- light cereal sweetness and grain. A lackluster finish with only drinkability standing in its favor. BTW- we gotta get Australia off the origin for this Canadaian contract- that's almost as bad as them putting Bitter in the name but no hops.",2005-06-11,917,Foster's Special Bitter
3.5,5.0,2.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,"Appearance - Big fat can, somewhat cool, but not that cool. Pretty dark amber color. If this is a light lager, it's the darkest light lager I've seen. Nice head of foam - tall, long-lasting and more sea-foamy than soapy. Lot's of thick lacing. Smell - Pretty strong for a light. Easy to pick up the maltiness. Smell itself isn't real great, kinda sweet and adjuncty. Taste - Surprisingly light, watery and ordinary. Lots of sickly sweet adjunct taste. There is some noticeable hops bitterness, though, that does give this beer more character than most lights. Finishes with a metallic twang. Mouthfeel - Full for a light, but not exceptionally so. Still quite watery and thin, but better than most. Definitely has some beer characteristics. Not as nostril cleansingly fizzy as most lights. Drinkability - Crisp and refreshing. The little bit of bitterness helps this beer stand out. The flavor really isn't exceptional, but it beats the heck out of most lights. More beer than water. Foster's Special Bitter looked great coming out of the can, especially for a light lager. Unfortunately it doesn't quite live up to its appearance. That is not, however, to say that this isn't one of the better light lagers - it is - it's just not that good.",2005-05-17,917,Foster's Special Bitter
2.67,3.5,1.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,"Poured from a 25.4oz can into an imperial pint. Bright copper with a decent head of white that fell after a minute or two leaving a thin ring. Smells like cooked veggies that were slightly rotten. There's some diacetyl for a second, then a whiff of aluminum. Hops are in there...somewhere. Quite possibly one of the worst smelling beers I've encountered. The taste isn't bad. Slight malt notes, then generic hops with a dry finish. More hop than malt, but its fairly balanced. Light mouthfeel makes this one go down easy, but the smell hurts the drinkability.",2005-04-30,917,Foster's Special Bitter
2.6,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,"Never saw this one before. Yankee Spirits (Sturbridge) had a special, buy two cans of Foster's for $4 and get a pint glass free. So I got one of each and the glass cheap. This was a nice amber colored, clear brew with a two finger head that was nice and foamy. When it died down it left lots of lace on the glass. The aroma was of mild hops, and a hint of slightly sweet malt. Not very strong. The taste... well, for a beer with ""Bitter"" in the name, it's not. Not at all. I get a taste of weak, watery medium malts, followed by some grains. Only a hint of hops.",2005-04-29,917,Foster's Special Bitter
2.75,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.5,3.5,"Surprised to see this in a divey little package store in the Massachusetts hinterlands. Not quite the bitters that I remember i Australia. Now I find out it is a light lager, but the can says it is an ale. I poured a little bit into a glass, but mostly drank out of the can (Hey, I was grilling!). The beer was a pale goldish yellow in color with slight carbonation. There was not much to the aroma, smelled like the aluminum can if anything. The flavor was very light. Mostly grainy, with a slight bit of caramel. Hops came into play just slightly. Mouthfeel was very light and crisp. Very satisfying after working outside all day. Very smooth to drink, not as bitter as some other Aussie bitters I had when I visited.",2005-04-24,917,Foster's Special Bitter
3.06,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,"From a 25.4 oz. oil can, lets see what this Aussie/Canadian brew has to offer. Appearance: Medium amber with a very large, frothy, off-white, mostly-diminishing head that is sticky and leaves quite a bit of lacing behind. Smell: Mild, bready, floral, soapy (not necessarily in a bad way) and straw-like with a little DMS. Taste: Much sweeter than I thought. Grainy with a light hops presence. It turns more bitter toward the finish, which is short and a little bit chalky. Mouthfeel: Thin-medium body, watery texture, and despite the huge head it only had a light carbonation. Drinkability: That slight chalkiness on the finish wasnt really that bad, but it just made you want to drink more. This isnt a great beer, but I was surprisingly impressed with this. Much more character than the regular old Fosters, but still light and easy-drinking. I had just come in from a run not long before cracking open this beer, so that probably helped its drinkability. A BIG improvement over the regular Foster's, I'd take this over most American macros... not like that means a whole lot.",2005-03-21,917,Foster's Special Bitter

Minerals and a slight hoppiness come in play. The carbonation tingles a tad bit. A very drinkalbe beer thought but a bit confusing. This beer is suppost to be 2.8% ABV, a light lager, but at the same time a special bitter? Doesn't the can say ale? Either way this beer is not to shaby.",2005-03-15,917,Foster's Special Bitter
2.26,3.5,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,"25oz large can. I saw it at the store and never had it before, and my own batch of bitter is bottle conditioning, so I figured I'd try it out. It's marked an ale on the side of the can, but it smells, tastes, and looks like a dark adjuncty lager. pours with a nice head, and after the initial pour does settle into a nice slow appropriate bitter style light carbonation. lacing is very light, especially considering how large the head is on the initial pour. (maybe my lips are especially greasy tonight.) the initial flavors are bitter-ish in an unidentifiable harsh mystery hops way, which devolves into a starchy adjunct corny middle, finally cut by a lightly metallic distantly harsh bitterness. it's not horribly awful, but it lacks a solid roasty malty soul, and tastes... cheap. (much like fosters lager.) mouthfeel weight seems about right for a mild bitter; maybe even a little on the thin side. but on the whole it's not terribly pleasant, and after finishing the first 12oz I'm debating whether or not do just dump the rest. I suppose it's intended to be drinkable, as it's packaged in a 25oz can. however, it just doesn't excite me in any way, and seems more as an excercise to demonstrate adjunct ale can be just as boring as adjunct lager. bah. that harsh hops-ish character only seems to be getting more annoying. down the drain for the rest. just one GENUINE character would make this drinkable. real hop flavor, or real malt flavor. as it stands, this ""bitter"" (imagine the air quotes) has neither.",2005-02-17,917,Foster's Special Bitter

Hop presence varies based on freshness, but there is always enough backbone to support the malt. Mouthfeel is among the best I've ever experienced. It shows what a beer engine can do for the right beer.  I've always wanted Victory to brew an Old Ale with this grain bill and give it a little brett.

Significant amounts of lacing are observed. S: Light to moderate aromas of pale and bready malts with a light amount of citrus/orange rind hops. T: Light to moderate flavors of toasted pale malts that have an almost buttery aspect to them with some light notes of citrus/orange rind hops and just a hint of lingering bitterness. M: Light bodied with moderate to heavy amounts of carbonation. Super creamy.

TASTE: Upfront it tastes like a very mild English pub ale much akin to the commercially available pale milds in nitro cans, perhaps with less character. Really light malt flavor, nothing much to report. The beer gets a light nutty note in the finish, and had a small note of mildly bitter, tea like hops.  OVERALL: A decent, run of the mill mild. The nitro made it drink like water, and nothing was off but it was surprisingly bland. Even as a fan of milds, I got bored with this one.",2013-04-21,4173,Uncle Teddy's Bitter

Toward the middle of the taste the smooth bready base remains, but the caramel fades a bit. While the sweet fades a somewhat yeasty and more herbal flavor take over the vacant position. Theses flavor carry the taste to a crisp end with a light hoppy flavor melding in.  Mouthfeel – While only at 3.9 % abv this beer is exceptionally creamy.

Poured a translucent gold, with less than a finger of white, and less than stellar retention and lacing. No visible carbonation wasn't surprising, given the cask origin. The smell was a robust bouquet of rosemary and other spices that I couldn't place, mixed with grass and sugary apple. The taste was very nice as well, tasting more like a saison rather than a bitter, and finishing on a dry apple note. Non-carbonated, smooth texture, and surprisingly thin which certainly aided its sessionability. Fantastic session brew. It definitely tasted as if the folks from Victory used the hops left over from brewing Saison du Buff to brew this great beer, given the herbal/spicey profile.

I haven't had much of the style, so I hope I'm not bringing my personal taste into the review too much. The beer poured fairly nice, with a yellow haziness throughout. The head was already gone by the time it was placed in front of me. Aroma was interesting. I detected a fairly blah hop profile at first whiff. Flavor was a little bizarre, but perhaps it was just a shock to my palette. The anticipated english bitterness was present, but it was topped off with a whole lot of honey flavor. Carbonation was low, in keeping with the style I suppose, but with the big honey flavor, it was kind of like an experimental soft-drink. Or a cup of tea and honey that had sat overnight on the counter. Mouthfeel was a little syrupy because of the low carbonation/honey mix. It was interesting, anyway. Given the above criticisms, drinkability is pretty high. If you like honey flavor, you'll like this. Ultimately, the flavors are mild and inoffensive, and the lack of carbonation and low ABV makes this a pretty easy drinker.",2010-11-05,4173,Uncle Teddy's Bitter

3.9,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.5,"Served in an imperial pint glass at ChurchKey. Especially during my last hurrah there, I had to get a random cask selection at the CK. My brother helped me choose this one. It pours a slightly hazed pale straw topped by a tiny smattering of bubbles yearning to be taken seriously as a head. In vain, I say. The nose comprises strawberry, ginger, candi sugar, flowers, and caramel. The taste is surprisingly simpler, considering the smell: Notes of wheat, flowers, and corn are all that make up the assault on my 'buds. This meager list does well, though, even if not very far. The body is light, with no real carbonation and a fairly dry finish.

Beautiful amber in color with a dense, soft, off-white head with just phenomenal retention and lacing, this is an outrageously beautiful beer. The nose is outstanding. Toffee, butterscotch, caramel, minerals, earth, mild minty and a touch of fruity English yeast, this puts the craft back into ""craft beer"". The palate opens with butterscotch, vanilla and caramel with some minerals coming through.

The beer pours a golden amber color with good heard retention and lacing. This beer smells so good... I get warm bread, wheatberries, light apple cider vinegar and a touch of bitterness. The combination is very appealing. Flavors replicate the nose in this smooth, easy drinking, lovely bitter. Mouthfeel is light, soft, long, and so flavorful. Drinkability is just about perfect. It's nothing short of amazing that a 4% beer can have this amount of flavor.  It's easy (or at least easier) to make a great tasting beer with 10% or more alcohol.... but a beer with this much flavor and 4% alcohol is a rarity. Exceptional. Well done Victory....",2010-04-25,4173,Uncle Teddy's Bitter

Appearance: As served the beer is a clear, pale reddish copper color with a ¼"" creamy slightly off white head composed of lots of fine bubbles that persists for a while producing some rings and some light lacing on sipping. Throughout most of the beer sipping leaves fine speckles of lacing with some of the early rings and patches of foam clinging to the glass. Smell: The aroma is gentle and floral with a lightly bready character and with definite presences of earthy hops. Taste: The favors include a touch of caramel malt sweetness and a slight malty breadiness and fruitiness, but through out there is the earthy bitterness from the hops. Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is medium bodied and smooth with the soft gentle carbonation. The finish is medium long and most of it is dominated by the earthy bitterness from the hops which persist nicely and leave me wanting another sip.

4.12,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,"Uncle Teddy's Bitter has a hazy, dark orange body with just about no head, which mean no lacing or retention. The aroma has some light sweetness, with cracker and toasted malt sweetness. There is also a light fruitiness and some spicy hops. Malt flavors that feature a touch of sweetness along with a good dose of cracker and toasted malt dominate the flavor in Uncle Teddy's Bitter. A little bit of fruitiness comes from the ale yeast, and a dash of noble hops balances the malt out.  Light, not carbonation, warm. It's from a hand pump, and it feels just about right. A lot of time when I order a beer from a cask, I really get the feeling that the brewer just threw a beer into a cask without really thinking about whether that beer belongs there or not.

The aroma is pretty simple- some light malts and a very faint hop smell. This was a very simple, palatable beer- the bitter kick was so subdued compared to my previous experience with bitters- perhaps that's the result of something I can't quite put my finger on. The beer being deliciously warm mellowing it out? I don't know. It had a nice bready flavor with a little caramel malt as well. Mouthfeel was light to medium with little carbonation.

3.63,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,Reviewed on 7/10/08. On tap at Blind Tiger (nitro-conditioned cask). Pours a cloudy light with a nitro head. Aroma of light sweet malt and flowery hops. Flavor is initially fruity with a bitter hoppy finish. Super super drinkable and very tasty. I think the nitro works well with this beer and really makes it so smooth and drinkable.

4.53,4.5,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.5,"From the cask this beer looks damn appetizing. Had it at Victory and absolutely LOVED the fact that they use imperial pint glasses for their ales- not to mention proper glassware for everything, but back to the point...  This bitter looks like it belongs in merry old England. Deep golden and copper color topped off with a creamy white head that seduces your mouth, tongue and perhaps your very soul. It smells of an excellent malt character with the proper bittering hop aroma. Every single quality ingredient comes to fruition once the pint glass inches towards your lips and that first sip trickles in. Indicative of the taste is the mouthfeel, its velvety smoothness entices every orifice of your mouth until the very last drop. This is a session beer at its finest, although it is hard to just have one, you must realize that while at Victory the rest of the beer lures me in like birds to a bird feeder (i'm sure that i'm not alone).

The taste starts with a silky malt base that props up a nice presence of lemon zest and grassy bittering hops. The mouthfeel is light, easygoing, and creamy with a bit of a dry finish and feel.  A really solid example of a Bitter from Victory that keeps a decent amount of flavor packed in while still maintaining that lower ABV. I love the fact that they keep this on cask at all times now at the brewery as the silky body only adds to it's immense sessionalbility.

The nose is light and consists of a bit of malts and spiciness. The taste is very good. It is a somewhat dry malt taste, with a good amount of hops that results in no sweetness but limited bitterness. A tad biscuity also. This was also served at cellar temperature.

Smooth, starting slightly sweet with flavors of light tea, honey, soft white bread and a touch of yeast far in the background. Warm and gentle tingling bitterness follows, very clean, noticable but not overpowering. Finishes super creamy and fairly rich. Mouthfeel on cask is just killer, so rich, creamy and smooth.

4.44,5.0,3.5,4.5,5.0,5.0,"Unbelievable, at least on-cask. Looks absolutely incredible. The head just wouldn't go down. It was so beautiful I just let it sit for a while. Seriously. I normally call beer God's gift to man. Sometimes you need to just sit and appreciate. I couldn't get too much of a smell. After the head eventually got down I got more of a smell. I have a poor sense of smell, so I'm not going to hurt it too much in the rating. The taste is a little heavy on the hops, but the beer is made from second-runnings of Old Horizontal so that makes sense. The malt is perfect up-front. The aftertaste is hops, but not overpowering. A very good drinking beer. I would tone down the hops just a little bit (only in the aftertaste) to give this a five. This style is delicate so I suggest not tinkering with the recipe. Yes, that's right. Don't listen to me! The mouthfeel is as smooth as silk. Smooth, smooth, smooth. Drinkability? I can't get enough. This is the ultimate session brew. This beer shows Victory's incredible versatility. They do big-beers well. But they do medium-strength beers well. And they do these small beers well also. My hat is off to them.

Aroma was pretty subdued but hinted at apples and pears with a dash of malt sweetness. Very mild tasting with no overly strong flavors and a very clean finish. Hints of pears and apples and the malt sweetness carried over from the nose. Mouthfeel was amazingly smoothe going down. A truly impressive feat and something I have not experienced very often in a beer. Could easily drink a lot of this and not get sick of it.

Once it's settled from the handpump pour, the body is a hazy golden with an orange cast that's topped by a thin cap of creamy bright white foam that holds quite well and leaves some lace. The aroma is limited but offers a subtly fruity, mostly malty character with a light earthiness that's probably contributed to by hops although they're not distinct. The flavor is quite mild combining a soft, clean thin maltiness with a light floral and earthy hop flavor. The body is light with an exceptionally fine carbonation that's extremely smooth and lightly creamy. The finish continues much as it started but without the sharper hop flavor.

Mouthfeel: As it's a self-proclaimed ""session beer"", the mouthfeel is naturally on the thin side. Carbonation is moderate.  Overall: While it's not something I'll necessarily seek out, I respect it for what it is: a truly sessionable beer that manages to offer considerable flavor and some degree of complexity.

Brownish and off-white head that takes its time settling out. Soft malt aroma with even lighter hops and hints of the oak aging. Pleasant. A little tickle on the tongue and soft malt flavors. Dries out quite a bit on the finish and is quite long. Nice streak of English hop flavor through the middle and a contributing lingering bitterness on the finish. More of the oak seemed in the aroma. Bigger body than anticipated. Probably enhance somewhat by the bigger than normal of very soft carbonation for style. Nonetheless a nice mouth feel. This is a solid beer.

The beer poured a cloudy golden/orange color with a nice 3-finger white head that hung around awhile and left some spotty lacing. After reading other reviews, I am curious as to why half of us got a cloudy pour and the other half say this beer is clear. I wonder what accounts for the difference. The beer has a nice bready malt smell to it with a lot of fruit in it as well. Nice mix of sweetness and soft bitterness here. Caramel and vanilla are the predominant flavors, but there is also some oak woodiness and some soft but spicy hop bitterness for balance.

Nice and nutty Taste: Very rich oaky nuttiness right off the bat here. The kicker with this bitter ale is the balance that the high hoppage and the strong use of wheat creates with the malt.

Transparent, lots of active carbonation. 1cm head, white, quickly recedes to a ring around glass. Thin wisps of lacing hang around after each sip. I detect smells of caramel, vanilla, and oak, lightly floral hops, with a mineral-like faint undertone. Dominant is the malt sweetness - caramel and the woody or oak scents. Good, but may appreciate a bit more oak or hop character. Taste is of biscuity malt flavors with some bitterness from hops. Slightly oaky, but would like more. Mostly malt sweetness and hop bitterness, not much of the complexity from the nose. Aftertaste is very nice, of light, wood-aged beer. Very smooth, with mild hop bitterness. Light to light-medium in body, beer foams up in mouth due to carbonation. Feel that it's slightly overcarbonated, finish is dry, from hop presence. This is an ok beer. It's sessionable, but the fairly lackluster taste and foaming mouthfeel are a turn-off.

I could easily drink more than one of these in a sitting because the sourness keeps the taste interesting.",2011-03-31,56938,Long Haul Session Ale
4.3,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,"An oak aged ESB? A'ight, I'm down with that.  Pours nice and amber with a big head and a tiny bit of a pleasant haze. Smells like rounded, sweet barley with light nodes of caramel and chocolate. Like a more nuanced and well rounded Fat Tire. Tastes, surprisingly, like a more nuanced and well-rounded Fat Tire. No ashiness, no sour hop bitterness on the backend--just lots of smooth, sweet malt. Starts off lightly floral and this moves quickly into biscuity grain, ending with light, dry european hops and a small amount of burnless oakiness. I admire any brewery who, in this age of mindless hoppy excess, puts such care into building a flagship session. This is a very, very nice beer.",2011-03-22,56938,Long Haul Session Ale
4.08,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,"Chilled bottle into a glass, courtesy of lurchingbeast. Thanks! Bottle says ""best by 3/16/11."" Well, no sense in holding it for a tasting now.  A: Pours a clear, but very dark, ruby-copper body that glows brilliantly against the light. It is capped with two fingers of off-white head. Good retention, with nice register marks and trails of lace down the sides of the glass.  S: I'm surprised to pick up a mild oak note. Serves me right for not reading the bottle description: this is aged on French oak foudres (casks). I guess that explains the tannins. It has an apple cider aroma that borders on tart, along with toast and grain.  T: Oak is stronger in the taste, though it's not harsh. It nicely accentuates the tartness I picked up in the nose: apple cider and dark fruit come to mind. I want to say grape. It has a nice toasted grain flavor; the grain in particular imparts a mild sourness, if that's the right description. Faint flavors of yeast.  M: Light-bodied. It has a dry finish with some mild bitterness. The pour seems to have extracted all the carbonation, as what's left in the body is mellow and supple. Well done.  O: Very tasty beer! I'd definitely have it again.",2011-03-20,56938,Long Haul Session Ale
3.36,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,"Bottle. Poured into a DFH tulip glass a copper clear color with a 1.5 finger head of light tan that quickly settles, leaving some lace as it goes down. The aroma is that of sweet, lighlty toasted bread or biscuit. I don't pick up really any of the oak notes but it does have a ever so slight fruity aroma to it they may be caused by the oak. Medium/light mouthfeel. Sweet caramel like start with a light drawn out flavor that just sort of melts away. Nothing overpowering here in this one. Would like to see maybe a dash more hop character to this along with possibly more of the oak. Overall, not bad.

Smell is somewhat off, with a cider-like aroma and some caramel malt. Almost like oxidization of a wine. Taste is a bit better, with some caramel malt notes, along with some floral hops. Creamy mouthfeel and a dry finish express the style, although the smell and flavor didn't do it for me. Session ale? no. This beer just seems wrong in many ways.

A bit of spotty lacing and a nice cap and collar as it goes down. The nose brings some slightly-caramelized malt along with a touch of fruit and some toffee.

Wicked easy drinking and totally poundable. Way tastier than expected, and nearly meets the ""session beer"" definition of &amp;lt;=4.0%.

An oak backbone is displayed as well. T/M: The front is a hoppy bitterness, that soon turns into a rich malt taste, that is layered. The mouthfeel is creamy, like most Two Brothers, but the oak adds a nice dryness to the finish on the mouthfeel. The oak adds a large roll in the overall finish of this beer. Rich and complex on the off tastes. D: I find this to be extremely drinkable, it even tastes like there should be more ABV then there is. Great tastes and complexities.

S - Tiny hints of vinegar and sourness are reminiscent of a Flanders Red. Lots of crisp oak in the aroma. Mild English -biscuity smelling malts. No hop aroma. T - Great flavor for a session beer. A lot of the oak pulls out with low malt notes that don't really contribute much beyond a backbone. Well-balanced hop flavor on the finish. Mild overall. M - Medium-bodied and round with a touch of carbonation tickle to the finish. Crisp like a lager with a nicely balanced bitterness to the finish. D - Lots of flavor for a session brew.

The aroma is of a sweet bready malt with some brown sugar notes; perhaps a touch of vanilla as well. The flavor is of a steely caramel malt, some fruity and metallic notes, sour oak, grassy/earthy hops, and a bit of a brown sugar/brown ale thing going on. The feel is light to moderate with soft to tingly carbonation; generally sweet but has a touch of sour and bitterness to help balance. A very well made and solid feeling brew.

This is a nice dark session ale aged on French Oak Foudres...whatever it takes this beer definitely doesn't suck. Appears a dark caramel amber hue with a bright white head finely speckled evenly across my pint glass. Aroma has hints of apple cider, french oak, and fruity undertones. Flavor is wonderful dark fruit, raisin, tart apple and oak belonging on my palate as a comprehensive flavor profile with each sip. Carbonation is mellow has all get out, and it goes down smoother than any other barrel aged beer I've ever had. Extreme flavor but limited alcohol and body that doesn't outweight, long haul is a perfect concept meant for the craft beer revolution.

3.87,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,Had on tap at The Mark A- Poured a apple cider looking color. One finger off white head shows medium retention. Nice web lacing on the glass itself. S- Light darker fruits in the aroma with a hint of yeast. Bready malts come through as well with no hints of hops at all from what I could tell. T- Big darker fruits come in the front of this with a light sweetness. Bready malts in the middle mix with a yeasty flavor to boot. No real hops in the backing except for a quick bitterness in the backing. Toffee flavors come and go through the entire beer. Mostly malts in the entire thing. M- Medium heavy mouthfeel. Carbonation is light for the beer...almost like a cask ale. Darker fruits and toffee are left on the palate with light alcohol in the aftertaste. Flavors were pronounced and well blended. Alcohol drying is medium on the palate from the beer. D- The ABV on the beer makes this very drinkable. Although this beer is not my style at all and I don't really care for it flavor wise. This beer is judged on the style and not my personal preference though therefore it gets the marks it does.,2010-10-02,56938,Long Haul Session Ale
3.73,4.0,3.5,4.0,2.5,4.0,"Growler from Bierkraft poured into a tulip pint. A--Dark copper, nearly chestnut body with a two finger fluffy eggshell head. Nice looking English-style ale. S--Fruity, very much English ale-yeast driven. Muted apple, orange, and toffee. A little bit of dark breadcrust sneaking in there. T--More fruitiness pulls through throughout the tasting. Same deal: apples, oranges, and then a sweetish honeyed toffee taste. Very much a malt-driven beer--the hops balance, rather than bitter, the finish. Maybe some spicy rye in there? M&amp;D--The mouthfeel is a little rocky-it's just not smooth enough for a low-alcohol beer. I taste some astringency and alcohol bite. The drinkability, though, is fine, as I can gulp this with no harm, no foul, and no regrets. I didn't get the vanilla or oak notes that the liner notes herald, but I don't really expect them from this kind of beer. Which, by the way, I'd call an English Dark Mild, rather than a Bitter, because of the diminished hop presence.

3.23,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,"Rusty pumpkin orange with bright tangerine edges and crystal clarity. Almost two fingers of golden beige fluffiness was produced on the pour. The foam looks good as it melts, as does a loopy necklace of delicate lace. The aroma is primarily toasted malty with a modest earthy-herbal hop presence. Hard to say about the oak. If blinded, I never would have given it a mention. Not a great lead-in to the flavor, but let's let the beer speak for itself in that regard. Two Brothers Long Haul Session Ale would be better beer if it dispensed with the oak and contained more hops. Then again, the brewery needed to distinguish this offering from the other 'J Series' brew, Resistance IPA. I'm not saying that oak aging and session ale don't go together, just that this one could have been done better. The malts are gently toasted and caramel-like, while the hops (27 IBUs when fresh) add a balancing bitterness and less than abundant hop flavor. Probably something English. The beer has an odd sour fruitiness and a background phenolic quality that isn't vocal enough to completely ruin the choir. Probably a less than tidy yeast strain. Or a wild one. Come to think of it, I'm reminded of Blonde Bombshell from Indigo Imp out of Cleveland. The mouthfeel is appropriate for the ABV and the brewer's intent. It never descends into wateriness and the bubbles are neither too scarce nor too abundant. Slightly better than average sounds about right. Although TBBC Long Haul Session Ale sounds good on paper, it falls a bit short when beer meets taste buds. It might be worth a brief jaunt (single bottle) if you're curious about an oak-aged English bitter from an American craft brewery, but it isn't worth a long haul (sixer) for this BA.",2010-08-01,56938,Long Haul Session Ale

This is a nice looking beer. The aroma is of toffee, vanilla, caramel, a hint of cherry, and toast. This isn't the strongest aroma, but it has very good complexity. The taste is similar to the aroma, and full of wonderful subtleties. The finish is of lingering vanilla and very mild cherry.

In the aroma I pick up some diacetyl and a little acidity. A little vanilla comes out as well. I do not detect any hops which is unfortunate. I taste a lot of malt that gives this beer a bready nature. The diacetyl comes out again. Not a deal breaker in this style. Very balanced between the malt and hops. Hard to conclude that this beer has had any ""special aging"". I would place this beer more into the ESB style as it is more balanced than a Bitter. Light body with very low carbonation. Could of used a little more life in the body. About the only great thing about this beer is its low ABV which would make this sessionable.

A: Hazy light brown with a two and a half finger just off white head with some nice rolling texture on top. The haze is actually pretty slight, and when held up to light, the beer borders on amber golden. Lots of active carbonation. This looks pretty pretty to me. The head lacks dexterity and lacing though. S: I was surprised at how the hops filled the air when I first opened this guy. They subside, though remain in a pleasant floral aroma, and a caramelized vanilla-y bread like aroma hangs over the pint. Maybe a little bit of cinnamon? I guess this might be a little too ""sharp"" though really it isn't sharp at all. T: MMM. So flavorful for such a low alcohol brew, and yet so light. A lot of similar tastes as there are smells, though not much floral hops going on here. A mild oaky taste comes though, not oak like in a big RIS, more like what I imagine drinking from a fresh cut oak chalice would taste like...in a good way. But again, a little more bitter than I want in what I think of as more of a mild, though on this hot day, it's great. M: Nice and sharp with a good carbonation. D: Amazing.

M: smooth, supple, a bit oily. seems much fuller-bodied that the abv would indicate. again, not necessarily what i'm looking for in a session beer. lacks a crispness (probably mostly from the oak aging) that i prefer in a session beer.

I get more from the malts here, with plenty of a toasted biscuit and breads flavor from malts along with a light caramel sweetness giving way to a floral hops backbone. There's a very prominent green apple tartness to it as well, and right up front and lingering all the way through is a tangy flavor on the back of the tongue. The finish is tart and dry and lingers well, finishing with a mixture of hops bitterness and herbal tea leaf. The body is on the light side of medium, plenty creamy with just a nip of crispness.

M- This beer has a light mouthfeel with a fizzy finish that cleans the flavors except for the hop bitterness.

Nothing great, but good complex tastes between the malt, some hops, and the French Oak. I can see this as a session beer to keep around, rivals their Domain Dupage which I like as well. Nice keeper for the abv. Medium heft in the mouth, lightly carbonated, just a decent drinker for the seasons between summer and winter. Very drinkable, one to keep around as a regular.

4.12,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,"I've been knocking these out at an insane pace for a time now and thought it might be time to get moving on reviewing this beer finally. 12oz bottle goes into the New Belgium tulip. A: Pretty beer, great color. A dark and clear maple wood brown, like this beer looks like it took its inspiration from a fancy, big city lawyer's desk. Head fades into a quarter inch cap in a minute or two. Leaves behind lots of sandy white lace. S: Very doughy and rich, I believe the barrel aging lends some of this character to this beer. Lots of dough, light caramel, but big on sweet, doughy breadiness, maybe a little bit of a vanilla/nutty barrel character, but sweetness leads the aroma followed a little way behind by a light and crisp apple.  T/MF: This bottle is a bit different than I remember it from the tap and in past bottles, little bit of a washed out/slight watery flavor mixed in the with what is described in the aroma. A few more sips and I am getting more out of this beer. The barrel character comes out a bit more, slightly woody and a bit of vanilla/caramel sweetness. The driving force behind this beer however is that big (for a beer this size) sweet, doughy hammer. The feel reveals a bit more than the taste does in that it leaves a slight dryness behind on the tongue. From beginning to end though it is solid. Full feeling upfront and all the way to the finish. Carbonation is light and feels cask-like, pretty good all around. D: An interesting beer to end up in a barrel considering the hyped up beers being put in them today, but I really like what the barrel has done to this beer and think that subsequent versions of this beer could get even better. There are some weaker points to this beer where it seems things tend to wash together midway though the drinking session, but otherwise this beer adds up to a fine session beer.",2010-04-14,56938,Long Haul Session Ale

It's just the right amount of woody character that mixes with caramel malts and hops in this session ale, although I think I'm drinking this a bit too cold. I think if it warmed up a bit the flavors would open up a bit. My guess is that I'm drinking this right out of the fridge at about 40 degrees. Going to let this warm up a bit. Warmed up and the oak seems to express itself a little more with a very woody character, as opposed to the vanilla which it can sometimes contribute to beer.

Got a flight at the Gritty McDuff's in Portland ME:
Halloween Ale
Cask Best Bitter
Maine's Best IPA
Pub Style

All were exactly the same amber color, with the same head. The aroma was exactly the same, except for the Pub Style. I also had a pint of their Black Fly Stout, which fortunately did have a different color.

I iterated between their Halloween Ale, their IPA, and their Cask Bitter. All were exactly the same, except that the Cask Bitter was slightly warmer.

When I suggested to the waitress that the beers might have been mis-poured, she said that they were correct, that she was also a bartender, and that she could tell from the color of the pours.

Assuming what I drank was correct ...

I found the beer was watery, and it was as though they used poor quality water. All their beers had an off after-taste ... as though their was a Gritty McDuffs flavor they added to all their beers (including their stout)

Mouth feel was watery. And a little evervescent ... a slight bite from the c02. Interesting, even the cask best bitter had a slight CO2 bite to it.

Hops presence is extremely minimal, with only a hint of bitter at the tail end. The hops presence does build as you drink, but still a minority player on the palate. The body is very light, and there is a smooth and creamy texture that completely owes itself to the cask serving. The aftertaste is a slight linger of the toffee sweetness, with a slightly drying finish.

The taste is interesting. Sweet toasted malts underneath some very bitter flavors that I can't put my finger on. The aftertaste isn't as bitter as the rest of it but overall, it is a bitter beer.

3.13,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,"Pours a clean, golden color, or copper as the site says, with a half-finger foamy head. Not a lot of carbonation as this beer settles into its short, fate-filled life inside a pint glass.  Smell is familiar. Its sweet, bready, yeasty and doughy. The smells intermingle more and become stronger as this one warms a bit. This is what is to be expected from the British style ales produced on the Peter Austin open fermentation system.  One sip and I am taken back to the last time I had this on tap. Its been awhile. Its very smooth, faintly carbonated and very swiggable. Plenty of malty sweetness with not a lot of after taste notes. This is a basic beer from Gritty's. I don't mean that in a bad way, I just mean its there flagship brew that is solid, simple and easy to drink. Obviously the bottled form has nothing on the cask conditioned drafts you'll find on tap at Gritty's.

I was expecting quite a bit of bread notes but they came in very faint towards the back end of the taste. Very little hops detected. The mouth feel is very light with just a touch of carbonation.

The aroma is malty and bread-like, with some sweet caramel in the mix...simple, but solid for the style. The flavour is again sweet from the caramel, but with a slight butter flavour worked into the mix as well. Bread notes tend to come through mostly toward the finish of each sip where they mix with a slight touch of hops. the mouthfeel here is light bodied and perhaps a bit overcarbonated. I would have liked for this one to have been somewhat flatter and smoother. I enjoyed this one. It is, overall, fairly true to the style and does a lot by doing very little (if that makes sense).

Good lacing- big splotches and strings in a consistent ring. S- little sweet, toasted country bread, malt, and some hop flowers. Little caramel notes as well.  T- Smooth malt/caramel flavor is quick, overtaken by surprising levels of hop bitterness, more than I'm used to in a bitter. It really lingers afterwards, but not totally unpleasantly- may be a little strong. Yeastier pour gives a little fruitiness.  M- thin, light bodied, carbonation is present but dissipates fairly quick. D- A decent beer- I had it with a ciabatta loaf sandwich, which I enjoyed. I think it pairs better with food than on its own as a night long session beer, as I could actually tire of its bitterness since it's a bit more aggressive in that aspect than other bitters I've had.

3.85,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,"An authentic, solid bitterness backs Gritty's amber-colored Best Bitter. That's not always something you find in American versions of this basic and very straightforward English style.  Beyond the welcome bitterness, it's basic, gently biscuity and delicately caramelish malt and yeast character. Of course, utilizing the Ringwood strain, that yeasty character is quite pronounced with lots of diacetyl backed by a touch of yeasty 'woody-earthiness' and some mild fruitiness.  It's slightly overcarbonated for the style, but when poured at the proper temperature a lot of CO2 will be given off at the pour, leaving it with a smooth mouthfeel that combines with the medium-light body to make it remarkably drinkable. Additionally, it will not really form the proper head if it's poured right out of the fridge so let it warm up a little bit. And when enjoyed at cellar temperature it's really a very solid session ale! The bottle I enjoyed had a new label from what's currently on the site, and it reads ""Gritty's Best Bitter"". It has the colored illustration of the bartender passing over a pint to a customer that I've seen before (probably on t-shirts as I haven't been to the brewpub in years).

The smell is of sweet grain, butter, mild Ringwood yeast, some hop fruitiness. The taste is buttery and yeasty. Despite that, enough grainy malt with plenty of fruity/earthy English-type hop bitterness comes through to give it a taste fitting for the style. Sweet balanced by floral/earthy hop notes in the dry finish. The body, which is rather thin at first, grows somewhat as it warms. A balanced flavor lingers. The diacetyl and noticeable yeast detract a bit, but it's not a bad interpretation of the style at all. Better as it warms, but never quite enough to overcome minor irritants about it.

It looks nice enough, although there is a paltry amount of lace. The aroma is a bitter-malt ale smell, backed by a heavy hit of what seems to be ringwood yeast. Smells like an ale plus the dry, bready yeast. Some dry malt character and a light hop presence. Yeast is heavy, hops are estery. Tastes like a real English bitter, *not* an IPA. Has the dry English ale taste. Hops and malt are strictly bitter, not flowery or grapefruity like an IPA. The bitterness hits the back of the tongue, and the yeast is the key element that separates it. It's thick-bodied, nice and chunky. So very dry, so very English. Smooth, but does leave a film.

Big diacetyl with just a hint of hop hanging in the background. The feel is moderate with a light carbonation. Another brew that could use a diacetyl rest.

The malt is biscuity and a bit raw and grainy tasting, with just a touch of sweetness. The hops have a sharp and edgy citrus bite, with a mild tea-like taste and faint metallic tang.

Note this brew contains one of my favourite (and a very versatile of) hops: Australian Galaxy, so in theory I’m going to enjoy this beer, but then again it’s a Golden Ale and I’ve never been the biggest fan of Golden Ales as they’re the bland trouser wearing cousin of American Pale Ales and as such they drive brown Volkswagen Passats and clean their spectacles with their shirt sleeves whilst listening to The Beetles, this is a very specific personification of a beer style but a valid one nonetheless. Poured from a 355ml bottle into a nonic pint. A: Would you be surprised to know that it has a clear golden body with a thin wispy half a centimetre white head? No? Neither was I. A standard by-the-book Golden Ale appearance then. 7/10. S: That’s Galaxy for you - always with the passionfruit notes upfront, not that I’m complaining - it’s a great aroma for any beer to have, just saying. Along with this are floral, toasted malt and orange blossom characters - the overall aroma is a dynamite combination and British restraint and assertive Aussie hops and I quite like where this is going. 8/10. T: The flavour is remarkably not what was expected with a bold toasted malt/toffee/honey hit upfront, some lemon/orange notes in the middle, and a light medicinal hop bitter and dry finish. The malts in this brew have somehow managed to overtake the Galaxy hops and I for one am surprised - I’ve brewed a Mosaic/Galaxy dry-hopped beer before and the Galaxy hops hold up pretty well against the powerful Mosaic hops - kinda expected a hop-forward brew here. 7/10. M: Mid to light bodied with a light English pub carbonation - suits this malt-forward ale nicely. 7/10. D: One thing I noticed as I got to the bottom of the glass is how the hops sneak up on you with a bitter aftertaste. In the end I wouldn’t say I’m a fan of this brew precisely because it doesn’t showcase the Galaxy hop as well as it could. It’s a half decent brew at 4.1% ABV (which is borderline mid-strength territory) however it needs better balance between the malt and hops (less malt and more hops) to really put it up there in the pantheon of great beers. The big question, the one that I ask myself again and again: Would I buy this once more? The answer is: Perhaps... pear hats. 6/10. Food match: A light mild curry, maybe a Tikka Marsala, with Biryani and Naan.",2015-10-15,72718,Old Golden Hen

3.96,4.0,4.25,3.75,4.0,4.0,"Old Golden Hen is golden alright, but doesn't look so old at all; it brims with a healthy golden colour, vibrant highlights and energetic bubbles. I believe 'brilliant' is the word to best describe it. Both the surface of the beer and the sides of the glass appear to be collecting dust.  English Bitters don't typically disclose (much less show-off) their hoppiness but this beer, brewed with Galaxy hops, is practically a ringing endorsement for the Australian hop industry. It is expressively floral, like a garden in spring bloom, and has heavenly notes of citrus blossoms.  Those soft flavours of citrus blossoms and orchard fruit (apricot in particular) continue on the palate, but more fleshy tropical fruit notes including mango, lemon and passionfruit turn up as well. The beer has plenty of maltiness but it's this wealth of divinely floral and tropical hop qualities that set this bitter apart from all others that come to mind. Indeed, all of this citrus character is super clean; in a way that few other beers ever have, its hoppiness showcases the delicate qualities of citrus blossoms and the brightness of citrus zest without even a trace of bitter pithy texture, stinging citric acidity, any candied sweetness or sappy resins. It is simply soft, delicate florals and a humble 4.1% alcohol.  Most English bitters compromise flavour (specifically, hoppiness) to ensure approachability and drinkability, but this ale shows us no sacrifice need be made! I honestly didn't expect to fall in love with Old Golden Hen as I have. Perhaps I shouldn't be so surprised given how impressed I am with Old Crafty Hen and how much I enjoy the flagship Old Speckled Hen. A great brewery.",2014-01-15,72718,Old Golden Hen

4.06,3.5,3.75,4.0,4.0,4.75,"500 mL bottle from a 4-pack picked up at the LCBO; served slightly chilled. Not sure what it is with UK brewers and these clear bottles, but my limited experience with this brewery tells me to expect something straightforward, well-constructed and highly sessionable regardless of the container. Pours a bright golden-yellow colour, clear as day and topped with one finger of frothy, white head that quickly evaporates. A soapy cap and generous collar remain after a few minutes' time. Great aroma on this one - biscuity malts, grains and honey, along with leafy hops, clementines and green apples. A few butterscotch notes as well, but everything comes together quite nicely - I am impressed at the lack of skunk, given the clear glass. Closed containers to the rescue, I guess? I'm in love with this after one sip - pretty complex for the abv, with plenty going on to keep me interested. Crackery malts and a light toffee note start us off, followed by a nice range of fruity tones including lime, bergamot and pears. The hop bill kicks in toward the finish - a little grassy, a little floral, but enjoyable all-around, offering a combination of bitterness and zest to finish it off. Light-bodied and extremely smooth-drinking, with the perfect amount of mild carbonation.  Final Grade: 4.06, an A-. I don't drink a lot of bitters, but Old Golden Hen is easily my favourite so far. The hops are fresh and interesting; the malt backbone is light but sturdy - overall, this is just a great English-style session ale. I've always had a fondness for bitters, and even though I haven't had a new one in a while, this brew immediately reminded me why I love them so much. I could drink this all night and not get sick of it - much better than Old Speckled Hen, which is a decent session ale in its own right.",2013-11-15,72718,Old Golden Hen

There's a gentle sugary undertone following. It's a little light. More leafiness comes out in the flavor than there was on the nose, a touch of herb, some green apple, and a bit of raw tobacco leaf.

A two inch white head dissipated fairly quickly, leaving a surface foam with moderate lacing bravely (or desperately, it was hard to tell) clinging to the sides of the glass. s. Densely floral or herbal with yes, a barnyardy mustiness, perhaps the skunkiness clear bottled beers are known to acquire. Still, to me in this case, appealing. t: As anticipated by the odor, an earthy floral sweetness balanced by hop bite. The kind of brew which must have been popular in the old British India, if available then, as an alternative to gin drinks. Refreshing yet flavorful. However, it becomes stronger-tasting and less drinkable as it warms.  m. Moderate due to the dense flavors and hops. Tastes of high ABV, but is in fact low at 4.1.  o. This is the second I've had out of the Greene King/Morland Brewery's ""Hen House"" variety fourpack. I liked this better than the higher ABV (6.5) Hen's Tooth, which surprised me because I generally like high ABV. But then it's all about flavor.

The label askes for the beer to be served cold, very unusual for a UK bitter, I'm sure the smells would have been stronger if the beer had been warmer. The beer is dominated by the hop content, the malts staying just below the surface and only coming out midway through the mouthfeel. I enjoyed the beer and although I prefer sweeter brews normally, this hoppier bitter was both refreshing and easy to drink.

Notes: the Galaxy hop variety is used in this brew, says the beer label. A: pours a clear golden hue with rather lively carbonation consisting of both tiny and huge bubbles, topped with a cream-white fluffy beer head that quickly retreats to a thin, lasting sheet. S: rather pungent aroma of hops dominates the nose, hinting at un-ripe guava fruits and sweet flowery scent, backed by a substantial body of pale malts with pleasant sweet edge to it. Pleasant and hoppy, if not lacking further complexity. T: quite effervescent, the foretaste gives a mouthful of yeasty+citric-fruity+zesty flavour with maltiness tuned rather softly at the back; turning mildly chewy and dry in the aftertaste, showing a decent integration of hop nectar &amp; bite with an unimposing pale malt body, ensued by a lingering floral edge in the end. M&amp;D: the flavour of hops treads lightly on a medium body, while the lively carbonation at times strikes as a bit too much to my liking, an effect retreating as the drink goes.

2.45,4.0,1.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,"Summer's almost over, so I thought I should drink this before it goes entirely. A 500ml bottle with a BB of May 2013. Picked up a little while back from Booths. Features an image of Dionysus on the label (the brewery's logo) - I previously thought it was a green man. Bottle conditioned. Poured into a tulip pint glass. A clear pale-gold hue with good carbonation and slight sediment (most of the yeast sticks resolutely to the bottom of the bottle). Yields a huge head of frothy white foam with good retention; this slowly subsides to a surface layer, leaving nice lacing as it goes. Looks great. The aroma, however, is not nearly so pleasant. A distinct note of harsh stewed leaves, faint solvent and sulphur. Virtually nothing else is discernible. Another reviewer mentioned that they thought the aroma was butyric acid, so perhaps that's what this is - at any rate it is vile and seriously detracts from the beer. Tastes of light malt with a dry, mildly bitter finish. Notes of stewed leaves, sulphur, earthy yeast and a whisper of citrus aroma. A restrained, dry bitterness upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth, tingly and full-bodied, with a dry character. Pretty astringent, with an aftertaste of harsh stewed leaves and a sulphurous note. Disappointing - I had expectations of this being a pleasant pale ale with a hoppy character. Not so. I looks nice and has decent body, but the aroma is horrid and the flavour also leaves much to desire. Not sure what's wrong with the smell but it is dominated completely by a harsh, sulphur-like quality. This carries through into the flavour, masking this ale's subtle malt and hop characteristics. All said, not a good drinking experience. It's a pity because I've had this before (ages ago) and liked it, so I don't know what the issue is here. Perhaps I should seek it out on cask.

3.58,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,"Hot neon banana peel that despite its incandescence is not nearly as brilliant as actual lightning. What I mean to say is that, sure, the colour is luminous, almost blindingly so against the light, but beyond that it isn't much to look at. Its clarity is smeared as if someone's greasy fingers were all over the glass and its head is depleted, sunken like a crater. There's no electricity yet... A hop back is a sealed chamber full of hops through which the wort (unfermented beer) passes before being cooled and then going into the fermentation tanks. What it does is impart and essentially trap additional hop aromas into the beer. Despite the brewery's name it is very doubtful they used one for this offering. There's maybe a hint of Noble hop but it takes a lot of warming to unearth.  Oh, wait a tick... there's some hops in here after all! The taste has the typical British maltiness, one of dry crackers and sweet bread, sort of drab and flavorless, but then the flavours of fragrant summer flowers, savory herbs and citrus-kissed lupullin wash over the palate. It is an almost potpourri kind of savoriness that combines a bit of spice, plenty of grassy herbals, fruit shavings and flower petals.  The mouthfeel is half-way decent considering I'm sure much of what gives it its liveliness was filtered out and the remainder pasteurized and possibly even loaded up with preservatives. The bitterness is present but feather-light; it flutters over the tongue, powdering it in fine resinous, floral particles. Its filling, medium-bodied presence also comes with an authentically grainy texture.  Summer Lightning didn't create any sparks. To be fair, it is (by the brewery's own admission) a better beer in its true element, as a real - that is to say alive, unfiltered and cask-conditioned - ale. It's sort of like having a glass of ice-cold lemonade in the heart of winter, you can taste it but you aren't really *tasting* it, if you catch my drift.

There's this off sour taste with a very noble, flowery/metallic-bordering-on-saaz-and-hallertau like hop kick to it. It has some nasty phenolic chemical like properties.

Nose is ripe and fragrant, lots of fresh fruit, maybe a bit sour from underripeness (that is, the hypothetical fruit that these malt esters produce). A touch of banana, some passionfruit, guava even and a hint of strawberry - although that just may be a slight tannic edge. Good generous smell of hops blends well. Delicious. Far more full-bodied on the palate than is suggested by the nose, and not so airy and fragrant. Rich bittering hop dominates with a slight grittiness which is not unpleasant but certainly unexpected in a golden Summer ale. The finish is extremely dry and feels like there's sediment getting caught at the back of my throat. It's not bad though, it's like a very good dry riesling finish. The star here is the palate. There is a rich bouquet of flavours here that makes it hard to pinpoint specifics. But it's slightly tonic, bitter and quite fresh, but bold and flavourful.

S: lightly stinky-earthy hay, an herbal edge of wild flower, and dried-tangerine-rind hops skirt the main theme of citric fruitiness; a swirl brings out a lightly mineral touch of yeastiness added to very clean &amp; light-bodied maltiness that suggests a touch of raw-ish, powdery wheat-malts.  T: an earthy-nutty (a bit like wet peanuts with shells!) and lightly salty-sweet yeasty foretaste, citrus-fruits, and juicy pale malts approach upfront in harmony, gradually deepening along with an increasingly tangy hop bitterness (like Challenger)...

Nose has qualities of butterscotch, grapefruit, wet summer pavement, lightly floral, a rocky seacoast at high tide. Some orange pekoe qualities rise as it warms. Head was an excuse of a pinky's worth of very active, noisy, off-white foam that faded almost immediately to a thin sheen floater with no lacing. Whoa...talk about sediment! The slightly hazy brew, ranging from straw gold on the bottom to a warm, orangish gold near the surface, is filled with suspended particles not moving, as if where they stopped during the pour was enough work for one day, screw the laws of gravity and say ""Thats it."" Its hard to believe, given all the noise &amp; activity that the carbonation made that there is none noticable. Slightly creamy initially with very mild orange, butterscotch and a hint of room temperature honey tones, that quickly changes with a semi-dry, crisp apple cideresque rush. The malts are finally noticable on the palate as it warms, more citrus qualities (almost like a weak Witbier) some leathery tannins. I do find myself slowing down, not out of any taste burnout or high ABVs, but just wanting to chill, relax, take my time. I am noticing this trend more &amp; more with beers of this style/genre. The ""sessionality"" of a good beer has much more to do with loitering, unwinding, letting go, not hurrying and rushing from one mild, easy to drink &amp; low ABV beer (usually English in origin) to the next, and this is a good thing, IMHO. It finishes semi-sweet &amp; semi-dry, crispy malts, cool on the throat with a semi-sweet coating that leaves a mildly chewy aftertaste and a faint, bitter echo. The sediment, once rather fine &amp; independent, is beginning to come together in larger clumps which do sink to the bottom, yet rise as a snowglobe flurry when agitated. My biggest revelation of 2007 is learning to appreciate the ""less is more"" in beer styles like this, so once again I find myself enjoying the soothing, calming, relaxing pace of a beer like this over the actual taste. I cannot quite place my finger on it, but maybe I'm starting to get this. This was good, a nice, easy to drink English Bitter that would excel in warmer weather per its name. Could pair very well with any grilled fare, some light, soft cheese, shellfish, or just a good hot sandwich. There are much tastier beers to be had, but this is a nice change of pace.

4.4,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,5.0,"Pours a very light gold color, perfectly clear, with a sticky head that leaves lacing and a collar. I'm surprised at how clear this is, given the bottle conditioning. Fine English hop aroma, combined with some sweet malts, monkey fruit and apples. On the palate there's a nice, snappy bitterness here that resonates like a rubber band stretched to the near-breaking point. Toward the finish the sweetness of the malts comes out, and adds a juicy burst to things, but this beer never veers over into ""sweet"" territory -- it's always very dry (which would make this a great summer beer). The finish is prickly and quite dry; it's bitter in the English way, not the American way (snappy not sludgy). Very lean mouthfeel, almost ephemeral, and very drinkable. This is quite a nice bitter overall. I would absolutely order this for session drinking, summer drinking, or bar food pairing (especially fried stuff like fish and chips). Very good.",2007-01-17,5785,Hopback Summer Lightning

3.67,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,"Poured into a small tulip it forms a big bubbly white head that has very good retention. Yellow body with slow rolling medium sized carbonation. Chill hazed or slightly unfiltered cloud. The carbonation is aggressive and sizzles a bit up front and doesn't allow the beer to really develope. The backend hops are well done and saves this beer. The flavor is excellent once you get past the sizzle. Gets a little husky 3/4 of the way through. Slightly grained up finish. Mouthfeel and Drinkability intertwine in this beer because the mouthfeel is soooo sharp that it detracts a bit from the drinkability. Overall a damn fine ""drop"" of beer. Notes: I'm really getting into english bitters and this one to me is a nice representation. More hopped up and on the dry end of the house for the style which fits my taste buds perfectly.

This doesn't have much of a nose although it is obviously rather yeasty. There is a faint fruity air. The taste is not unpleasant, but there isn't much going on here either; a pleasant light hoppy bitterness (I suppose that is why we are calling it an English bitter), a little sweetness, a return to an even fainter bitterness and, um, that's it. The yeast has surprisingly little direct bearing on the flavour. Rather bland for a brewery with hop in its name (in Oregon that means, boom, HOPS!) and not as rich as I would expect a golden ale to be.

This is an easy drinking light bitter.. hell, I am going to say it.. it is like Fuller's ESB ""Light""...

The white head was very thin and disappeared very quickly, as well as a very watery almost non-existent lace. The smell was very non-discript. Mild hops(light citrus and floral scent...but not very strong) and mild hops...really just smelled kinda like beer. The taste was hops in the front, malt in the body, and a hopy crisp finish. The hops were prominent but the malts were very well balanced. Mouthfeel/Drinkability: the carbonation was more than I expected for the style, but that did not bother me...The crisp finish made it refreshing. The beer its self had slightly more body than a macro(not watery at all), but was extremely easy to drink. I enjoyed it, but the awards boasted on the bottle had me expecting a little bit more.

Has a roasted malt character at first, which is a shock, abundantly bitter, then mellowing and sweetening a bit. There is a sour, lemony quality. Not sure what to make of this one. My first stab at the style. I'm unsure if I like it ... very strange. Very much like a pils in the mouts ... light, clean, biting, good to go. Nothing to complain about here.

Also some ripe apples in the nose.  Taste was lackluster, bordering on macro vibes. Hop bitterness comes out after a few drinks, as well as a metallic wang. Malts were a little cloying, hops came to the rescue. Very dry with little finish to speak of. A little thin, a little watery. Very chalky.

Nice carbonation. Pleasent mouthfeel for this ""summer ale"" style Comming off a local stout and porter I just did not find much in bitterness.

The aromas of this brew where of a hoppy nature! Had a pine and grapefruit hop aroma that was very noticeable and then had a solid malt smell that was biscuity and buttery, a very interesting smelling brew. The taste was nice, very well balanced between the hop like tastes and malt. The hop notes tasted more floral than citrus like IMO, and the malt backbone of this brew is real nice and as I said really balances out the brew.

Mouthfeel is quite smooth, light bodied but way too much carbonation for my liking. Notes: This beer certainly looked good, but the taste is lacking. It was much better once it warmed up. The bitter flavour really comes through at warmer temperatures.",2004-08-06,5785,Hopback Summer Lightning

3.31,4.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,"What better time to drink a beer called Summer Lightning than a humid, 90 degree July day. Too bad that there isn't a summer storm raging outside my window, lightning and all. Lucent pale amber with plenty of vigorous carbonation. It's so vigorous, in fact, that the head quickly overflowed my pint glass (like many of the Belgian beers do unless I remember to pay attention). The head is not quite cotton white and is persistent; stubborn even. It looks like meringue from a coconut cream pie, though it leaves no more than an average amount of lace, so it isn't all that sticky. The aroma is nothing too special. There's a whiff of sweet fruit, bananas perhaps, but grain is dominant. The flavor doesn't really inspire either; not bad, just not all that good. Untoasted grain and Brit hops are the major players on the palate. The finish is dry, crisp and yeasty sour.  There isn't too much wrong with the body/mouthfeel other than a few too many bubbles. It's too bad that carbonation is a doubled-edged sword when it comes to beer. An abundance of CO2 oftentimes makes for a great head and a powerful aroma, but it sometimes ruins the mouthfeel for me. In the end, Hopback Summer Lightning is a pedestrian English Bitter. It isn't horrible, but at $3.29 per bottle, I can't recommend it either. I'm tempted to say that a more appropriate name would be Summer Static Electricity, but that would be unfair (although amusing).",2004-07-14,5785,Hopback Summer Lightning

As you pour, the glass fills with enthusiastic sparkling bubbles that rush up to build a towering paper-white head which dies slowly, leaving scads of foam on the glass in its throes.  When cold, the scent is a piercing, flowery, cidery perfume. But as it warms it takes on earthern, funky, nasty overtones of ... hominy.  Sharp, pure bitterness up front overwhelms a faint-hearted sweetness, which tastes, unfortunately, of corn. As it warms, still more funk and sweetcorn comes through. Squeeze a whole lemon into the mix and a brief, tart finish and you have that rarity: a bottle-conditioned English ale that needs to be chilled ice-cold.  Thin-bodied with sharp and fizzy bubbles that prickle throughout the mouth. This is so disappointing compared to the cask, as if it had fallen from the sky and hit the ground hard.

3.14,3.0,3.25,3.25,2.75,3.0,"Sure, widgets make for an impressive pour - the first few times you see it. Unless you have the mental capacities of a child the 'oscillating sandstorm' visual quickly becomes tired and gimmicky. It's ironic too that a device meant to impart a distinguishing feature actually makes for identical looking beers; the artificially-induced foam is always the same. This amber ale looks as though it were made from a mold.  Belhaven Best also smells pretty much like every other widget beer I've had: wet cardboard drenched in corn syrup. Well, maybe ""drenched"" is a strong word, but this bouquet has a sweetness that I'd be surprised wasn't high-fructose fueled (think of cheap, mass-produced caramel, like the stale little squares wrapped in clear plastic).  The flavour does a better job of passing for an all-malt offering (though the impressions of stale, inferior quality grain and industrial sweetener return in the aftertaste). As is typical of British ales, there are subtle hints of dried fruit esters and chalky water minerals, both of which I suspect would be more pronounced were it not for that suffocating blob of floating nitrogen.  You might not guess it from this sample, but Belhaven makes a few beers so well-brewed and distinct that they're hailed by beer judges and journalists alike as the best examples of their respective styles (see: Belhaven Wee Heavy, Scottish Ale, St. Andrews Ale). Pick up any textbook on beer or brewing, flip to the section on British ales and you're sure to see Belhaven listed...  This offering, however, is a lesson in how to make bad beer - its maltiness is frail, the yeast muted, the hops non-existent; despite its agreeable strength (4.8%) only those with simple, undiscerning palates would contemplate ordering a second round. (Frankly, I don't even care to finish my first.) Putting cardboard through the blender would be just as stimulating to the senses. Belhaven Best is undoubtedly Belhaven's worst. What can I say? I guess you gotta make money somehow and, for reasons that I'll never understand, the majority of beer drinkers prefer something insipid, predictable, and undistinguished. I can't blame the marketing department for being unable to pass-up the ""The Cream of Scottish Beer"" tagline but I certainly don't have to support it.

This is a new one for me - I haven't had a nitro ale in a while, probably because I'm usually not all that impressed with them. But I'll try anything once. Pours an attractive amber-honey colour, cloudy at first, but translucent once the layers have separated out. On the surface sits one finger of smooth, creamy head that sticks around for quite a while. The aroma is sweet with lots of biscuity malts; toffee, honey and (most particularly) butterscotch are rather prominent. Fairly enticing, and definitely more robust than a lot of the nitro ales I've had. Fairly enjoyable taste, but no real complexity about it. Biscuity malts and toasted bread provide some backbone, with sweet toffee and butterscotch dominating the profile. Rather buttery, with light hints of orchard fruit with only some slight, tea-like dryness late in the sip. The aftertaste is sweet and malty. Silky smooth mouthfeel like most nitro cans, due to the very mild carbonation. Light-bodied and kind of watery, but drinkable as all hell. I found this highly enjoyable for a nitro can. Obviously the mouthfeel of these nitro brews is an acquired preference - one I have certainly never claimed to possess - but from an objective standpoint, this is a serviceable brew that I don't have a lot of complaints about. That being said - it's not one of the better bitters I've had in recent memory. The balance is rather poor, and there isn't a lot of bitterness, although it does finish cleanly.  Final Grade: 3.35, an acceptable B minus grade. Good stuff, and as a bonus for any frugal UK ale fans, it's quite cheap in these parts as well. Hopefully the LCBO keeps bringing in Belhaven's Best, because it's easily the best nitro beer I've picked up from there in years. Simple, yet solid.

Appearance: It took a while for the carbonation to settle, even for a nitro but it produced a finger and a half of head that sustained and laced like crazy. The body is amber with a tan coloured creamy head. Smell: An almost butterscotch like arroma (although more on the scotch side of things) with a tea and honey note. It took a bit of warming to come out, but when it did it was quite nice. However, I think I'm also getting an odd smell that I'm not used to and it's probably coming from the nitro. Taste: A malt explosion as toffee like malt hits you at the start of the beer, then gives way to a creamy mild smokey scotch taste that the nitro seems to reign in quite a bit and then ending with another hit of malt and honey taste. It's different that is for sure. Mouthfeel: I'm honestly a bit conflicted on this one. I mean it's creamy, offers a sweet malt aftertaste that quickly departs and doesn't overstay it's welcome, doesn't cling and transitions well, but part of me gets the feeling that maybe the nitro isn't needed. I dunno if that sound crazy or not. Drinkability: Normally I find that nitro enhanced beers tend to be heavy offerings that sit in your stomach like caulking. This is the exact opposite as if not for the massive amount of malt, would come across as almost too light. I had not problems getting it down and it seems to sit down quite well. Final Thoughts: I touched base on it on the mouthfeel, but I honestly wouldn't mind trying this beer without the nitro. I will say this though, this is probably the first beer I've had where I actually wanted to see a bit more bitterness involved.

T: Sweet caramel malts and a pleasant note of grain towards the finish, along with faint floral hops and a very vague hint of roastiness.

A tempest of light-amber foam courtesy of the nitro-widget eventually settles into a clear, bright amber brew, with a thick creamy head that, like all other nitros, remains steady for the entire pintsworth. Nose is pretty faint - malty, a bit of hops, caramel, and that unmistakeable ""nitro"" metallic odor. Smooth brew, fairly tasty, with a touch of grain and smoke to distinguish it from other BPAs I've encountered along these lines. A bit of fruit, caramel, slightly bitter finish.  Thin and watery, yet creamy. I'm not a fan of the nitro-can system, as I feel the brews tend to feel flat and watery, so its hard for me to be objective. I'll say this: it goes down very smoothly.  If canned pub ale's what your after, I wouldn't put this at the top of my list, but nor would it be near the bottom. It tastes fine, inoffensive, and the low ABV is a plus if sessioning's the thing.

3.43,4.0,3.5,3.0,4.5,3.5,"440ml 'Draught Flow' can, 3.5% ABV - more traditional British Isles pub ale for we new world acolytes (or perhaps apostates). This beer pours a clear, medium bronzed amber hue, with a top-heavy, rising bubbly menagerie, which eventually renders two fingers of puffy, loosely foamy, and wispy eggshell white head, and a Swiss cheese sheen of painted lace around the glass as it very slowly sinks away.  It smells of sweet, mildly toasted cereal grain, cheap honeyed crackers, Corn Pops, and very faint earthy, leafy, and weedy hops.. The taste is softly bready caramel malt, otherworldly corn syrup, wan pome and stone fruit esters, and a light, egregiously late-rising (been there!) earthy and leafy noble hoppiness.  The carbonation, as expected, is quite, quite low-key in its frothy astringencies, the body a solid medium weight, smooth, and oh so very creamy. It finishes still fairly sweet, the generally cereal-heavy malt not taking any guff from any sort of latent and/or lingering bitterness. A lovely beer, in the tactile sense, as this goes down so smoothly, the nitro puck really showing its stuff. However, for a bitter, there just isn't enough, well, bitterness - and that's not even close to keeping up with the old-country Jones, as it were.

Pours a slightly rusty, honey-amber colour with a smooth and frothy white head. Takes a good two minutes to settle, giving a nice cascade effect as it does. The aroma is very, very mild and takes a few minutes to be noticable. Smells of sweetened scotch, similar to oak or rum barrel aged beers like Innis &amp; Gunn. I also get dark, toasted malts and a slight graininess. Tastes of wood with a slight smokey hint to it. Chocolate comes through after that. The finish is more sour than bitter and slightly cloying. The mouthfeel is quite creamy and smooth; there is little to no carbonation aside from the long-lasting head. One the sourness of the taste's finish wears off, I find a crisp and clean aftertaste. It certainly isn't bad, but just not as smooth going as I remember. The smoky notes in the taste and sourness in the finish are a bit off-putting for my current palate, but it goes down quite easy after a pint or two.",2011-08-18,9684,Belhaven Best
3.53,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured out has a nice looking deep copper color. The head was creamy looking and white. The smell of the beer is malty and has some nice sweet grainy aromas coming off of it. The taste of the beer has a subtle sweetness upfront that fades into a dry bitterness in the end. The mouthfeel is light but remains creamy. Overall I enjoyed the beer, I like most of what I've had from Belhaven thus far. Not a bad brew to try.",2011-07-19,9684,Belhaven Best
3.68,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,"I'm excited about this beer, if only because it will be my first nitro-can review. I haven't had a nitro-can in years. I'm quite impressed! The nitro-can have a nice cascade of fine carbonation as expected, though not as interesting as a Guinness. The beer is a darkish copper colour and completely clear. There is a nice centimeter head that is extremely creamy. This looks like a draught beer! The aroma is very faint, but it is almost entirely malt... And a very sweet roasty malt at that. There are some hints of honey and maybe even vanilla in there. The flavour is not what I was expecting! It has an incredibly smooth mouthfeel, probably due to the low carbonation. The flavour is kind of subdues by this, and also by the low alcohol content, but it is a pretty decent beer! The malt flavour dominate the pallate. It is slightly sweet, but never too much. There is also some light hop flavour towards the end. The drinkability of this beer is very high. I could totally sit in a pub and down several pints of this. I might even buy this again if I was in the mood for a light beer with some flavour.",2011-06-22,9684,Belhaven Best
2.56,4.5,3.5,2.0,1.5,2.5,"Poured from a 440mL nitro-can into a Blackthorn pint glass. Best before 11 November (hopefully 2011). 3.5%. A: The can exploded (mostly into the glass) with creamy head and produced the beautiful downward drifting bubbles that makes nitro-things look so interesting. Two fingers of tight, creamy head. The beer is burnished copper and quite clear. No visible bubbles once the head settled. Some lacing. S: Rather nice-smelling for a canned beer (prejudice, I know -- I've had some bad experiences). A nice bitter scent, which is only partially attributable to hops. What smells like roasted, or at least toasty, malts. T: Thin and almost tasteless except for a vague sour maltiness. The creamy head is odd-tasting, but mostly neutral. It reminds me vaguely of weak, transparent Guinness, but I suppose that's the nitro. Aftertaste is thin and unpleasant. Not impressed. M: A thick creamy head on top of a watery excuse for a beer. Ugh. O: I liked this one a lot better on cask. Starting out less than terrible, but as the head got consumed, quality plummeted. Not bad enough to pour out, but I won't be having any more Belhaven from a can. Stuff like this is why people think they don't like beer. Needless to say, not recommended.",2011-04-18,9684,Belhaven Best

It is a fairly weak beer but i enjoy how it doesn't leave you bloated due to it not being particularly fizzy. It leaves a sweet taste in your mouth making you lust for more, so is easily drinkable.

M: watery, light/medium body, little much carbonation for a bitter. D: Easy to down a few of these over a meal and not bat an eye, too weak for my taste.

Head doesn't dissipate at all, with some lacing all the way down the glass. Smells very mild, some floral hops and biscuit malt. Flavour is just mild bitterness, a bit of sweetness. Creamy mouthfeel, I'm pretty sure this is on nitro. An ok beer, nothing too great though.",2010-12-12,9684,Belhaven Best
3.06,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,"Purchased at a walk in beer store location. A Thick creamy off white head with the usual cascading effect of a nitro can shoots through the clear amber body leaving caul fat like lace. Smells of roast malt and light caramel balance a light hoppy aroma and a hint of sulphur. Some nitro smells prevalent. Light malty notes are the main flavours here with some backing roasted flavour. A strange sensation of sour cream and a slight nuttiness present themselves submissively. Hopping can be detected int he latter half of the sip, light but adding some balance.  The body overall is watery though mouth coating with medium low carbonation. This provides a smooth refreshing quality. Not a bad beer it would be good with standard pub fare.",2010-11-26,9684,Belhaven Best

1.73,2.5,2.0,1.5,2.0,1.5,Had this again the other night just to finally seal my impressions. Emm... Doesn't look horrendous but that uniform foamy head was a sign of things to come. Almost devoid of odour this tasted slightly tinny at best. Body was fat and bloated letting very little resembling flavour escape. Like an over inflated tire about to burst to be honest.

3.46,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,"ABV 3.5 nitro-can Excellent honey in color, but with thin off-white head, lingering for a long time. Sweet bready malts in aroma.

3.28,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,"Pours a slightly hazed golden honey hue with one and a half fingers of creamy, frothy egg white head that refuses to go away, leaving thick patches of lace down the glass. For the style, the nose is well rounded and decently pronounced with toffee, wheat, bready malts, and honey all thrown into the mix. It leaves a bit to be desired but is inviting none the less. The taste is more subdued than the nose would lead you to believe. All of the flavours that reveal themselves in the nose are still there but are taken away from by the slippery, water-like mouthfeel. This one goes down very easy, but it seems like the smoothness and quaffability of the beer took precedence over the actual flavour of it. Maybe that's why it became ""Scotland's number one pub ale""?  Overall, I'd say this beer, like nearly all beers, has its time and its place. It's a good interpretation of the style and I think it's been amped up a bit since it was first put into this system, jumping a percent higher in ABV. Pints of this can easily be crushed, but on most days I still prefer a full flavoured, savoury beer over a quaffer frothing froth quaffer like this.",2010-08-24,9684,Belhaven Best
3.33,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,"Enjoyed on tap following a round of golf in St. Andrews. A: pours a dark amber with a decent head that leaves behind loads of lacing. S: sweet malts and wheats are about the only discernable aromas that can be found. T: rather bland, easy to overlook the malts and wheats that are evident. MF/D: easily drinkable as a session beer as there is not much flavor. almost flat, but very light would be the obvious conclusion.",2010-08-07,9684,Belhaven Best
3.11,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5,"I like the way beer cans with widgets pour. Lots of nice head &amp; bubbles ""cascading up"". Nice dark honey-brown colour.  Didn't smell like much. Taste was OK. Nothing too exceptional or noteworthy. A little caramel / toffee... maybe, I guess.  As much as I like the cans with nitro / widgets, I don't like how they feel. They feel very flat in the mouth.

The taste backs up the smell: sweet. Malty sweet, little alcohol. Insipid: I'm happy English has that word because it fits. Amazing that this ... liquid comes from the same folks who brew Belhaven IPA. Order something else: life's too short for this. Luckily the company was good on the train from Aberdeen to Inverness.

Not nearly so attractive in cans, even with the little nitro bomb inside.",2010-07-06,9684,Belhaven Best

Something to session if nothing else is around. This is not a bad bitter. Just a bit boring. The nitro does not help in that regard.

Look is great, thick 1 finger head with almost laughable lacing - the entire glass is coated.  Smell is all nutty caramel malts, not too intense, but it's a best bitter after all - no men's room smell like john smiths has.  Taste is flat but nice some great lightly sweet caramel notes at the start, and a hint of dry hops at the end followed by just a slight essence of spice.  Drinkability is good, mouthfeel is a bit too light.  Totally drinkable, decent brew for the style (is on-tap bitter even a style???) anyway, does the trick on a nice Glaswegian Sunday afternoon for 4.99 with a Sunday roast!",2010-03-22,9684,Belhaven Best
4.01,4.0,3.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,One of the best beers i've tasted from Scotland. Brownish in colour with dominant burnt/caramel notes [both on the nose and taste] probably due to the pasteurisation regime in goes through.

2.77,4.0,2.0,2.5,3.5,3.5,"This appears to be the main beer on offer in the majority of bars accross Scotland, sadly. The pint pours very well a lovely bronze colour with a very thick perfectly formed creamy head. However this looks fake straight away, it looks manufactured and that is why I did not give it top marks. The nose is virtually non-existant, it is not horrible, I just couldn't smell anything. The taste of malts and caramel dominate the taste. Not bad, but it lacks any real character and the tastes that exist are quite bland. The mouthfeel however is good, nice and thick with a clean aftertaste. Very, very smooth in the mouth, but again this feels manufactured, not natural. I would drink this if there was nothing else on offer, but it is no better than any other manufactured beer out there, especially with the number in Scotland. If you are desperate for manufactured beer then McEwans Export or Tennents Special are both, in my opinion, better alternatives. This lacks any real taste, not sure where Best came from, they should be sued for misleading information.",2007-08-30,9684,Belhaven Best

Poured a standard clear, golden ale colour with a decent fluffy white head. Aroma was difficult to discern in the pub, but some mild grassy hops and a bit of unbaked bread yeast in there. Flavour is very mild with some tangy hops to spice it up a bit, but nothing too exciting. Good, smooth mouthfeel and very little carbonation and aftertaste make this a highly drinkable, if dull, session beer.  Seemed almost ubiquitous in pubs in that part of Scotland.

Take one."" I had one for me, and one for my underage cousin! I'm repeating my appearance score for the Best from my draught and cask reviews. The aroma, while muted by the can, still showed caramel maltiness with the creamy head.  Flavors are creamy and smooth, the body is perhaps a touch thin but out of the can remains delightfully creamy. Dark fruits, ripe but not overly, come in and out of the flavor; otherwise a tasty mild bitter.  It's definitely a mass market brew, but tastes good enough to do in a pinch. My marks might be adjusted downward to account for the fact that it was 1. on the golf course, and 2. free. Very nice!",2007-06-11,9684,Belhaven Best

The ale is a darkish copper, with some good sized chunks of sediment, floating around in it. Smells of toasty, nutty malt, lightly sweet and kind of earthy rich. The flavor is grainy malt, again with a faintly sweet, roasted nuttyness, then swings smooth and balanced with a nice hop finish. Smooth and creamy in the mouth, good body and superb nitro-carbonation, make this tasty brew a pleasure to enjoy. I was very suprised by this one, had never heard of nor tried it before.

Clear, slight reddish color with a slight effervesence. Smell: Aroma is malty and slightly sweet. Taste: Dominated by the nitro - very creamy mouthfeel, but not a whole lot of taste to back it up.

This beer is very drinkable and I would not pass it by if it was offered to me.,2003-10-22,9684,Belhaven Best
3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,"Another sad example of how not to package a great beer. The usual presentation for the nitro: pop the tab, dump into the glass. After the bubbles do their trick, an amber color beverage appears. First sip, watered down. I hate writing this review because you sense this is a great beer that has been destroyed by the ""widget"". A little hops, but I could not get by the watered down taste. Even my wife commented, ""this would be a good beer after mowing the lawn."" Tragedy.",2003-08-29,9684,Belhaven Best

Great lacing, leaving a ladder up the glass. Aroma is very much the bitter style. Malty and slightly fruity, with a bit of hopping in the back. Strong pear aroma, with a sweet creamy malt. Solid. Flavor is creamy and malty, with a nice nutty finish. Reminds me of that same aftertaste you get when you eat hazelnuts. No apparent metallic taste. Light earthy herbal hops, blending seamlessly with the malt. Balance like whoa. I can't tell where the malts begin and the hops end. Awesome. Damn fine beer, even in the can. I'd love to try this on tap or cask.",2003-08-21,9684,Belhaven Best

Medium copper color, Orange looking at times, rust or brown at times depending on the light. Bubbly thin tan head. Toasted smells seem to dominate. Taste was smooth and sufficiently bitter, nice hop presence. Always a somewhat metallic taste to finish. Hard water ? Not sure, but it happened more than once. Nice nitro creaminess to it, but it seemed to get a little watery at times. Overall an easy to find, pleasing experience.",2003-07-13,9684,Belhaven Best
2.69,4.0,2.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,"This is one nitro can I am not totaly fond of, way too sweet with a steely caramel aroma and flavour. The nitro seems way over forced and the flavours too processed.

On balance, although I've been pleased with several of the imported ales available in nitro cans, I was disappointed with this one. It poured out a nice brown color but, unusual for a product in a nitro can, had a very weak-looking head. The smell and taste seemed lighter than I would have expected for a ""Best"" - very little hop flavor - more like a summer ale. Certainly a drinkable product but I find it hard in this case to justify paying the premium import price being charged for a 4-pack",2003-05-15,9684,Belhaven Best

It did have a cool seperation effect though. The head stuck around forever too, so I liked that. The taste was a very nice creamy taste, somewhat similar to the Wexford, but a little bit deeper in taste.

Mouth - Moderate carbonation. A little oily. Nice enough. Overall - This is an English bitter with a twist.

Finishes slightly metallic, like the underside of a bottle cap. Bits of fruit, figs and dates. Bitterness lingers. Feel - Light and refreshing. Has a cooling sensation like fresh water.

Bottle chilled down to 36 degrees F in my beer cooler and poured in to a handled-glass stein. Pours a deep reddish-amber in color with a thin off-white head. A decent amount of lacing is seen when sipped that stuck to the sides of the glass. The aroma is for the most part English malts with a hint of fruit. The taste is the sweet malt right up front followed by a hint of fruit and finishes with a slight bitterness, which wasn't hoppy though. Actually very tasty as I have never had this type of brew.

I have to say I love it when pubs pull out the specific glass for the beer they are pouring...in this case a tall 20 oz pint with ""Adnams"" molded into the glass at the bottom.  Poured a nice gold color with a 1 cm off-white head (pour was nice and slow so head was not as pronounced as it would have been with a more robust pour).  Not much nose...just a touch of English hops. I do wish the English bitters would give me a little more in this respect, but it was to style. Good clean taste with nice malt/hops balance, although it was not particularly flavorful.  Clean mouthfeel...could have been a little more ""juicy"" in my opinion.  Overall, a very typical bitter. Nothing to get excited about, and probably not something I could pick out of a blind taste test against other similar bitters.

Taste: sweet malt with a little bit of toastiness; much of the fruitiness from the aroma is pared back. Hops are earthy in character and the bitterness is quite nice. I like it.

3.68,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.75,"500ml poured into a mug, with soup, cheese and crackers for a dreary Sunday lunch. I feel like a true Englishman. Appearance - Nice dark amber-brownish color with light haze. A sticky and bubbly off-white head is a solid finger for most of the duration, eventually giving way to a partial cap. Leaves bits of lace. Smell - Straight up lighter-end pale malts mostly. Light caramel/brown sugar sweetness, some light+dark fruits, black tea, bread. Just hints of herbal and grassy hops. Quite tame but pleasant with no off-flavors. Taste - Toffee, vague light fruitiness, some raisin, biscuit, herbal and grassy hops. It's subtle by nature, that is a good thing here. Light pleasant flavors, nice malts for 4.1%, low sweetness+hop bitterness. Mouthfeel - Very smooth, drinkable, and an impressive body for the ABV. Carbonation is on the lower end but right where it should be. Overall - Certainly not the most exciting beer/style by today's standards, but it's something that I always appreciate and can really hit the spot given the occasion - like a half-liter with lunch for example.",2014-03-30,5413,Adnams Southwold Bitter

The figure depicted on the label is 'Southwold Jack', a local icon and an emblem of the brewery. Poured into a tulip pint glass. A deep orange-amber colour with medium carbonation. Forms a decent head of frothy off-white foam that lasts for a minute or two before collapsing to a patchy surface layer. Aroma of caramel malt with fruity yeast esters, stewed hops, faint grass/hay and a hint of sweetness. Tastes of caramel malt with a dry finish. Notes of caramel, fruity yeast esters, stewed hops, mild grass/hay and a dry earthiness. A subtle bitterness upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth and tingly, with light carbonation and good body. Slightly astringent, with an aftertaste of dry stewed hops and fruitiness. A decent bitter, if a tad unexciting. Would be nice if the hop aroma was more prominent, but overall this is balanced and well-crafted. A easy-going ale that would be perfect for sessioning.

The dough apparent in the nose carries through with the taste. Very lightly bitter, this is a nice English ale. FEEL: Medium bodied, smooth, creamy and delicately carbonated. A more than quaffable session beer. OVERALL: Bottle claims the Adnams brewery of the year in 2011.

Pretty average. The flavor continues the English fig, prune, toffee characteristics but I like that there is an additional bready/grain flavor. Everything is just a tad bit muted but no off-flavors are detectable. Bitterness is light with great grassy hop flavors.

Aromas begin with earthy, floral hops with some emerging fruity green fruit esters with some more herbal hops in the background. As it warms you get some of the malt base composed of heavily toasted bread, light minerally aspects with some emerging caramel maltiness.  The tastes begin slightly biscuity and toasted maltiness with some minerally aspects in the finish. Hops are lightly bitter but balance the malt sweetness, mainly earthy and herbal. Some fruity English yeast esters also emerge as it warms. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with medium carbonation. Finish is slightly bitter with a slightly balanced malt sweetness.  Overall this was an enjoyable beer that I enjoyed while eating my Malaysian dinner the other night. It is extremely drinkable, never boring and just a quality example of an English Bitter, one of the top ones I've had in the US for sure.

3.43,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,"500ml bottle - surely this is the same offering as the 'Adnams Bitter', no? This beer pours a clear medium golden amber hue, with two fingers of loosely foamy, dirty white head, which leaves some low shoreline lace around the glass as it quickly settles. It smells of grainy caramel malt, thin apple orchard fruit, and some mildly bitter leafy, grassy hops. The taste is somewhat biscuity, grainy malt, with some breakfast butter character, a simple drupe fruitiness, and herbal, leafy hops. The carbonation is generally quite sedate, just a bit of sass here and there, the body medium-light in weight, and haltingly smooth, a slight indistinct edge floating throughout. It finishes off-dry, barely, the grainy malt, apple skin fruitiness, and leafy hops conspiring and conjuring that particular effect. A so-so bitter, not really up to the spec of a Fullers or John Smiths, with an off kilter, and overly dominant fruit nature. Good for one, I suppose, and then it's simply time for something else.",2012-11-09,5413,Adnams Southwold Bitter

4.17,3.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,"Reviewed from notes. Pours out a clear amber with one and a half fingers of white foam that lasts for about three minutes, minimal lacing left behind on the glass. Medium-light body and carbonation levels, crisp snappy finish that has a fairly decent sustain to it. Smells of buttery toasted bread with a light fig jam spread on top. The sip, however, is markedly sharp and bitter with an initial attack of strong herbal-woody and medium earthen hopping over biscuit malts with another garnish of fig jam... it is VERY much drier and bitter on the tongue than the nose had led me to expect, and I'm liking it very much. I'm not normally a big fan of diacetyl, but somehow this beer has managed to have a reasonable modicum of butter in the aroma but hardly any at all present in the flavor, which works out for the best IMO.

3.8,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,"Usually not my fav style, English bitter, but I'm trying to get a liking for it, so hopefully this helps my cause. Pours a nice looking creamy bubbly 1 finger head that seems to just sit there like it has no place to go, and leaves nice lacing on the sides as it dances around them, over semi clear auburn honey brown color. Nose has a typical earthy bitterness, just slightly herbal and grassy, a light coppery like aroma the good kind, a light sweet caramel and toffee malt aroma, hint of honey malt as well. The hops get a bit more grassy and quite aromatic the more I nose. Taste gets more bitter, a definite English style bitter. Earthy hops, bittering hops, fairly grassy and herbal but bright, chewy even. malts bring more caramel and toffee like, but light soft and almost juicy like. bitterness grows to a decent mark as it goes, with more of that grassy herbal taste, and a slight nutty like flavor with just a touch of bready dough malt. Slight mint and tobacco like hop character, with a bit more sticky sweetness. Finish is drier but still slightly sweet and sticky, more herbal grassy hops and little malt flavor lingering. Mouth is med bodied, soft though, with decent carb. Overall better than I though. The herbal earthy grassy hops don't really turn me off, and in fact bring some interesting characters that I'm actually enjoying this beer.

Bitter up front, with toasted malt in the background. A little thin and lean. Looking for some sugar and fruit, and the sweetness is there but limited. Finishes long and bitter.

Smell is pretty faint with some slight malt and fruity aromas. Taste is of malt, slight fruit, and some herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a medium level of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the smell is pretty lacking in my opinion.",2012-06-09,5413,Adnams Southwold Bitter

S: Minerally lemons and biscuity malt, very English and fragrant. T: Great taste of biscuity slightly sweet malt and minerality. The hops bring light notes of citrus to the party. Very flavourful for the low ABV. M: Light-bodied, crisp, exceptionally easy drinking, fairly clean finish. O: A tasty drinkable pint, this is a good one, haven't had a new British beer in a while and this didn't disappoint. I can only imagine it's even better on cask.

3.68,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,"There's nothing like settling into an imperial pint of English bitter. Like an hat that's been broken in and comforts the soul, this beer does the same. Although the beer is new to me, there's something very comfortable about it. While pouring a deep copper hue and nearly brilliantly bright, the beer's calm carbonation separates into a dense blanket of foam across the glass. With firm retention and lacing rings, the beer mimics the look of cask while poured from a bottle. Somewhat muted aromas of toffee, biscuit, toasted pecans, and starch carry a pleasant and mild scent while the earthy hop aromas come to life with a leafy, piney note that accents esters of oranges and figs very well.  Flavors are moderate and balanced, propelling the malty-sweet rich taste of toffee and biscit just ahead of the mid palate of hop bitterness that also carry the taste of leaves, stems, and pine needles. The well-melded balance leaves a dry malty sweetness to broaden on the palate while giving a juicy quality to the orange and fig undertones. Medium bodied, the lighter carbonation allows for fuller appreciation of malt, but also drying somewhat in finish for a smooth and creamy minty cool/dry evaporation to occur. The ale has an overall very approachable and masculine quality- although it's difficult to celebrate an one attribute, it's the balance that makes it so charming and comfortable.",2012-05-26,5413,Adnams Southwold Bitter
4.02,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,"Happy Hour at my house. Bust out the cheese, the summer sausage, the crackers, and a half-liter of English Bitter. And let's warm that bottle up. What else to do? Oh yeah, on to the beer: A good looker after the bottle is poured. In the imperial pint glass, the color shines a copperish red color with a somewhat soapy head on top, leaving a semi-creamy lace around. The nose feautres some pleasant diacetyl, some earthiness, a some pinches of esters.  Light bodied, but full of flavor. Modest diacetyl and earthiness towards the start, the duel of flavors slowly die and give off a bit of sweetness from the malt. We start to get a sense of esters, very subtle pineapple, and some unmalted-like sweetness (like chewing on malt). Sure, the beer is light bodied, but it seems like there's some meat on its bones, and the carbonation level is just right (not overly carbonated, and not really flat).  It's nice to come across a bitter stateside. Even better to come across one that has held up on the voyage acorss the ocean. Pleasant mix of flavors here.",2012-05-22,5413,Adnams Southwold Bitter
4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Poured from the bottle into a 10oz pint glass at Churckey DC. From notes. A real nice light tan off white head hits on the pour, and barely falls if at all. Dark chestnut brown body withe amber and orange sides and hues, and a fairly crystal clear appearance. Very good lacing on this drink as it clumps throughout at times while finishing. Nose brings a soft malt body, and mostly semi toasted bready malts. Not much else, but really pleasurable and simple and solid. Taste strangely on first quaff is a mild cheap tobacco, similar to cigarettes, but certainly tolerable. Chewy graham cracker malt and milk depth, with a fairly bitter hop finish, giving to an earthy feel. Overall a real mellow and chewy classic bitter that is worth seeking out.",2012-05-17,5413,Adnams Southwold Bitter
3.88,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,"1pt, 0.9oz bottle poured into a tulip stout glass. Date stamp says 1346 21:12 - whatever that may mean. Appearance: Clear dark coppery orange. Tiny bubbles coming up through the beer slowly when held up to the light. Thin skin of white foam across the top with some occasional strands of lacing noted. Very nice color with this beer. Smell: Herbal and mild buttery note with just a bit of skunk in there. Skunkiness goes away as beer warms up.  Taste: Malt with a hint of diacetyl butter and hop bitterness mixed together at the beginning, and finishing with a sharp bitterness. Definite English style hop bitterness here. A tasty example of an English bitter.  Mouthfeel: Good carbonation but a little watery underneath, although it does remind me of just about every English bitter I've ever had out of the bottle, so really spot on for style. I suspect it would be better on cask. So in other beers I might feel the mouthfeel was average, but in this case, it works well with everything else going on and is just right.  Overall / Drinkability: Quite drinkable and I think a good example of an English bitter. I could easily see myself having another one. Like all English ales needs to warm up for a bit after coming out of the fridge before you get all the flavors and the real character of the beer.",2012-05-09,5413,Adnams Southwold Bitter

S: There are light but unique aromas of buttery malts and fruity yeast in the nose; these become a lot stronger as the beer warms up. T: The taste has a light amount of bitterness along with hints of butter and toffee. M: It feels a bit higher than light-bodied on the palate with some hints of chewiness and has a light amount of carbonation. O: This beer is quite flavorful given its low alcohol content, which makes it rather sessionable.",2012-04-28,5413,Adnams Southwold Bitter
4.32,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,"Southwold Bitter pours a deep mahogany caramel amber color with a slightly hazed appearance. Head is thick and tan full of froth, with fine even lacing. Earthy, leather notes of complexity even some fruity grape notes more concentrated raisin even, with a hop nose of earthy herbal hops. Complex enduring flavors of butterscotch, caramel, blended with earthy herbal hops dominating eachother into submission to create an exhilarating layer of balance. Which exudes the palate into wanting more and more, a very easy to consume complex low in alcohol English bitter. Mouthfeel is complex with a hint of diacetyl but doesn't knock you down, rather it balances out other aspects that the beer has to offer. Medium bodied evenly carbonated this beer I'm sure is supreme on cask.

Light earthy hops and light malts hitting you first. There is a tiny amount of bitter that is detectable and a touch of fruit too. Earthy hops and malts that are coupled with some light, summer fruits and some bitterness. Light bodied and smooth although not quite falling into the watery category, there is a mildly bitter taste and a hint of dryness to the beer. Average with mild carbonation. Although not a bad beer really it was far to mild and lacking in any strength or flavour where it counted and not a beer that I particularly enjoyed or would go back to. 1001 Beers Blog: http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com",2012-04-09,5413,Adnams Southwold Bitter

There is just a slight bit of sweetness, grain, and pine but it's mostly the bitter flavor that you taste. There's also not very much to the finish, most of the flavor you get on the initial part of the sip. Mouth Feel:  This is a very carbonated beer and nice and crisp. Overall: It's a very good beer in this category and a good one to drink to get introduced to bitters. However to me it just seems to be lacking a prominent second note. Beyond the bitterness there really isn't much else to it.",2012-03-20,5413,Adnams Southwold Bitter

My imperial pint glass looks so gorgeous right now. It smells grainy with a fruity backbone and has some light bitter notes. The taste has some grain like in the smell, more bitterness than the smell, a kind of aspirin bitterness that doesn't hit my palate all that well. It finishes slightly on the sweetish side where the medium light body gets a bit thin.  This is not a bad Bitter. The abv is nice and low and drinkabilty as far as said abv goes is great.

A few spider web streaks of lace on the descent. Smell: Toasted barley husks in the nose with an ill-defined sweet-scented trace to it, discarded fruit skins, and some earthy, woodsy English hops. Taste: A taste of wet toast with a little, light caramel sweetness that quickly recedes away. A bit of apple skin, a bit of red grape skin. Earthy, woodsy, faintly herbal hop character with medium-light bitterness. Faint toastiness remaining in the predominately hoppy (though, even that’s still quite restrained) Mouthfeel: Medium-light body.

3.64,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,"The beer pours clear and amber, the color of freshly oiled mahogany. The head is a thick lip of fine, khaki bubbles. The beer doesn't quite achieve the look of a hand-pumped pint, and the head quickly thins to a stubborn few millimeters. The aroma is freshly baked pastries laced with hop nectar. The caramel malt backbone is quite rich for the strength of the beer and holds up the hops well. The hops are rather fruity - peaches, nectarines, meyer lemons and a hint of pineapple - with touches of mineral notes. The taste is a bit sweet, and there isn't quite enough to the hops to pull it together. The caramel malt verges on sickly, medicinal sweetness, though it's certainly not a fatal flaw in my estimation. Carbonation is low, and the mouthfeel is fairly smooth, but it's a pale imitation of a cask. It's hardly the fault of Adnams. I'd just love to try more English ales fresh out of a cask. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and, once again, am amazed at how much flavor English brewers can pack into &amp;lt;5% abv beers. Of course, not having sampled the casks of England, I really have no idea how it compares to the style. Perhaps, if I was surrounded by bitters, I wouldn't praise it so highly, but that's an issue for another day.",2012-03-01,5413,Adnams Southwold Bitter

3.8,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,I had this on cask at TJ's Restaurant and Drinkery's Shelton Brothers tap takeover event. Served cask temp in a nonic.  The color is a deep golden amber with very light haze and thick cream that settles gradually with fine bead and lace stickage is good. the smell is very herbal and has a nice fruitiness from the ale yeast ester which is slightly pear/apple tinged with a light spice in the nose almost comes forward as piney with a mineral element in the mix. The feel is good with light body mild carbonation as expected with moderate bitterness and fruitiness from the yeast which is tangy on the palate with a mild astringent tinge in the mostly dry finish.  The taste has a more piney flavor than the aroma lets on with some gentle bitterness which has a more herbal taste w/ gentle pepper tinge and accent with more yeast which brings a light alcohol flavor and subtle mineral tinge w/ a dry finish. The overall is a highly drinkable bitter -very quaffable. I would order this again as it is pretty full of flavor for a 3.7% beer.,2012-01-30,5413,Adnams Southwold Bitter

Start with the positive.. Good looking beer. Clear brown body with some yellow highlights. Solid head lingers and laces. Mouthfeel is quite big. Probably the biggest I've had for the style and ABV. It's full and very smooth. Perhaps I shouldn't mark a bitter so high for being so much bigger than the style dictates, but I'm looking for positives here. Ok.. The nose is quite tart and sweet - smells a touch like a Belgian triple or quad that had been left out overnight. Background cola and peppery notes. Taste is sickly. Far too sweet and sour.

Aroma: Smells of malt, grass and earth, with a slight medicinal note also noticeable, somewhat like military-grade cough syrup. Taste: That medicinal taste is noticeable up front. It's bitter all right, but not in a super appealing way. Almost has a paint-like flavor to it. Some maltiness and hops are present, but they're outweighed by rather unpleasant flavors. Mouthfeel: It's also thinner than I'd prefer. Not much body. Overall: I like a fair amount of Geary's product, but this isn't one of them. if I want a Geary's beer in the winter, I'll reach for their porter.",2014-12-27,14050,Geary's Winter Ale

There's a dryness in the aftertaste that I'm attributing to an over spicyness. Just as too much cinnamon doesn't taste good without the right amount of sugar, so too, the spices here are unbridled. All that malt &amp; spice w/no sugar creates a bitter aftertaste that's off putting.",2014-08-16,14050,Geary's Winter Ale

Goes into a nice fruitiness and has the signature Ringwood yeast butter flavor, but it is pleasant and nicely developed M: Medium bodied with moderate-high carbonation. Prickly O: I'm really enjoying this. It has a nice kick for a winter time English IPA, and drinks very easily. At $7.99 for a 6-pack, this is a solid deal too.

S: There are moderately strong aromas of toasted malts and toffee in the nose. T: Like the smell, the taste is quite malty and has flavors of toasted malts and toffee along with notes of caramel and hints of spices. There is a slight amount of bitterness. M: It feels medium-bodied and a bit smooth on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. No crispness is evident. O: This beer tastes very malty, even when considering it is an English IPA and not an American IPA, but this lends some more body to the mouthfeel making it a nice IPA for the winter.",2012-09-13,14050,Geary's Winter Ale

Considered drinking from skull of recently deceased enemy before remembering that I'd had Fruit Loops out of said skull that morning and had promptly discarded it. A: Poured with half an inch of light brown head. Clear and deep copper colored, little bubbles are visible rising to the top. Ring of lacing around the rim, and a thin film of foam on top remains. Not much lacing to speak of. S: A mix of toffee, caramel and plum. There's an odd hint of cough syrup as it warms. T: Caramel and sweet sugar plum with a biscuity finish. Light sweetness on aftertaste. M: Medium and creamy. Carbonation is a crisp and a little soda-like. Dry finish. O: This is an IPA? I normally don't read reviews before posting my own, but I checked a few others this time because it felt like something must have gone wrong. Not only did I not get any hop flavors out of this, but I'd be surprised if there was even a hop in the room where this was brewed. I'm not against that; in fact, I bought this and only later remembered hearing that it was an IPA, only to be pleasantly surprised that it wasn't IPA-ish at all.

As others have noted, there is a sweet, caramel, malt taste and aroma that I do not recall from prior years. I would definitley no longer consider this an English IPA as it is described.  The beer still has a nice coppery appearance in the glass, with a thick, full head. The drinking texture is also very good, with just the right amount of carbonation. Beyond that I found the taste a bit too sweet for my preference.

Blue label with the name ""Geary's"" in big, red, bold letters at a 45° angle across the front. Pours a nice dark brown, almost black hue with a solid head. Sadly, this was all I liked with this beer. It was overly sweet, with strong vanilla flavors that did not seem natural. The vanilla overpowered both the nose and mouth and was hard to move beyond. There were some chocolate malts mixed in there somewhere as well. I am not against a vanilla-flavored winter ale; though it's not my favorite style in general, I have had some I quite enjoy. This beer, however, was so strong in the vanilla, that it tasted like the brewer dumped a ton of imitation vanilla extract into each bottle.

The smell is butterscotch with some malty aroma coming out with a small hop aroma. Some slight toffee aroma within the strong butterscotch. The taste is all butterscotch and malty maple syrup flavor. This is a beer that makes me want to eat pancakes or French toast. A slight sugary flavor comes in with some slight toffee and at the very end a bitterness hits just slightly toward the end to hit all the corners. There is a great buttery flavor that seems to mingle with the toffee flavor at about mid sip and them mixes together on the way down. The feel of the beer is light but medium in body and goes down easy enough with a nice light aftertaste.

The beer is an IPA, maybe lacking a bit of character to be an English IPA. I'm not sure how that translates into a Winter Ale, at all. The beer pours a clear golden color (the lightest colored winter warmer I've seen), ample carbonation, a small white head, no lacing, just a tad bit of retention. The nose on the beer has the smell of ringwood yeast, a tad musty, a bit of English style malt. Not bad, a bit of diacetyl in the nose as well.  The taste is a touch biting, some leafy hop, but it seems to be faded. There is a decent and full palate of malts to this beer, some earthy, some a bit musty, some bready qualities, perhaps, but the acerbic bite, the yeastiness, and buttery flavors, diminish the maltiness of the beer. The bittering hop lasts too long into the finish and aftertaste.

Pours a light, golden-colored hue with a minimal frothy head that soon dissipated and left a negligent amount of lacing... For an IPA, the hop aroma was almost non-existent and certainly nothing to write home about... perhaps a faint suggestion of hops with a slight level of carbonation evident and a tinge of vanilla, but that's all... Less than spectacular taste, nothing to brag about at all... Geary's Hampshire Special Ale was great, but this one was a let-down... Bland, flat, watered-down taste with not much going on at all...

The aroma is floral, grassy and even spiced and yeasty, which I was not expecting.  Firm on the palate, the well balanced taste is made of floral hoppiness, bitter and spiced, with a balancing malty cereal sweetness.

The taste is pretty good with a nice toasted malty backbone underneath some wintry spices - some nutmeg and some citrisy flavors are layered over the malt and a citrisy hoppy bitterness.

It looked more like a 4th grader made it in some cheap Microsoft program. It offended me, and the beer's appearance grade suffered accordingly. The pour was a strange orange that looked dull in some lights, and down right toxic in others. Aromas were unremarkable, but not bad either. Taste started with some light fruits, like apples, quickly giving way to some grassy flavors and a hint of black pepper. I don't recall it being bitter, but every sip left me with a bitter face, as if my body was anticipating something that wasn't there. I think it was the fact that the feel was not quite crisp, but not leaving much of an aftertaste either. I'm just not sure how I feel about this one.

It finished a little spicy, nearly peppery, with lingering herbal/grassy notes and slight warmth. Medium to light bodied with average carbonation, a little on the dry side.

The flavor is pretty bland as well, giving only a glimpse of the malts and a tiny bit of some bittering hops. Light bodied with decent carbonation. The finish is mostly the bittering hops.

It's a bit thin for an IPA and a winter one at that. It does have some silky smoothness to it, but I'm thinking more from the buttery diacetyl than from anything else. Some alcohol and sweetness linger for a little while. Not ""bad"", and has a certain ""drinkability"" to it. But, it's not far from an English Pale Ale with a touch more alcohol noticeablility.

Moderate, to moderately light body and carbonation combine to give it a slightly thin mouth feel. Yet, it has pleasant hop flavors and lingering bitterness to assure you that you're drinking an English IPA.

T: The taste starts out with a pale and bitter hops burst, then some light spice &amp; citrus sweetness, and all backed up by a hearty toasted malt character. The after-taste is bitter and a little bready.  M: Crisp and smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, clean and dry finish.  D: Kind of tasty, goes down easily, not very filling, it’s on the light side for a “Winter Ale” and I can’t think of any other winter seasonals that delve into the EIPA style, so in that, I suppose this beer is somewhat unique.

Although, to be honest, I didn't recognize it as an English IPA... thought it was more of a barrel-aged (?) American amber. Oh well. Poured a cloudy, dusky gold with amber highlights. Good sized bubbly white head sticks around surprisingly long, although it didn't leave much lacing at all. Aroma is strong floral hops, with some additional kitchen spices. As it warms up, it gets more grassy with some mild sour citrus notes coming through, and weedy field flowers. Taste is very different from the aroma. Angel food cake and raw yeast, primarily, with lots of unexpected malt power. Strong vanilla and oak notes toward the finish, with those spicy floral hops holding up the middle. Very silky mouthfeel, although slightly overcarbonated. An oaky, tangy aftertaste that I didn't like that much, especially since that's when the unwelcome alcohol presence appeared (strange in a 6% beer).

Mouthfeel: Medium-bordering on medium/full. Moderate, creamy carbonation.  Drinkability: Geary's Winter Ale is a very nicely done, hoppy, well-rounded and drinkable ale. It's just a bit bigger than a pale ale, not particularly caramelish at all, and not as bitter as what most think of when they think IPA.

As was the case with the aroma, the flavour is lacking in hop character, something that should obviously be at the forefront of an IPA. Instead, there is alot of malty goodness with hints of butter and wood and with the hops scattered about throughout. There is a slight alcohol warming here as well, which was a bit of a surprise considering the tame ABV.

The head did not last too long, dying down to a thin film of foam. The aroma was lightly fruity, but too faint to really identify amidst the other scents. There was a little bit of caramel, and a definite floral scent.  Taste was of caramel and toffee initially, with some hop bitterness without any resinous character. Quite interesting... but not what I expected in an IPA. Mouthfeel was OK... just plain average. Nothing stood out. Drinkability... a little below average. I wouldn't get this one again if I wanted an IPA, either American or English. It just didn't seem to fit the style that well.",2005-09-03,14050,Geary's Winter Ale

Anyways, about the beer. It's a light orange colour with a thick white head of pearl coloring. The aromas are all fresh UK golding hops and some spicy, bready, biscuity UK malts. The taste is hoppy up front, but not IPA hoppy. The hops are spicy and meld well with the biscuity British malts. Tasty stuff. The mouthfeel is creamy and the drinkability is good.

Caramel, biscuit, pretty much a run of the mill standard type clean malt flavor. The hop bitterness overshadows the malt but overall balances making it not undrinkable.

The aftertaste is somewhat medicinal in character, a bit like mouthwash I'm afraid.

A nice hop wash arrives, tasty but not biting, a smooth lightly tingly sensation. A bit earthy, not citrus nor pine. The hops roll thru the aftertaste, pleasantly fading away. Nothing earth-moving, much less shattering, but enjoyable. Good mouthfeel, extremely creamy, and solid but not syrupy. Very easy drinkability, a fine winter session ale. A nice everyday beer for the winter, a simple, easy break from the spices and the Big Beers which abound. No Hampshire Special Ale by any means, however. As to style, while BA and the brewer's site list this as an IPA, a British Bitter might have been closer to the mark.

3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Clear, coppery in hue with a brassy shine as well, the color is lovely. The head was white in color; at the apex the foam reached one finger in height before quickly dissipating to a fizzy cap. There wasnt much subsequent lacing. There isnt much noteworthy about the appearance of this beer. The nose is pleasant, earthy from an English hop influence. Must be Golding and Fuggles. Light citrus notes. The malt construction is equally English. Caramel. Bread. Yeast must be Ringwood. Fruity. Buttery. I found an occasional whiff of alcohol. The potency is modest but the nose is plenty articulate; it helps I like what it is saying. The bouquet is organized just right; Im impressed. Inviting. The palate follows the path the nose setout. Honesty is the best policy, right? I hate beers that lie. This one didnt, so Ill be honest too. The palate isnt as good as the nose, mainly because I dont understand what is going on. Its a bit of a mess. Fruity and spicy at times, there is heat that comes from the alcohol and, it would seem, the yeast. Its like a candy heat; this clashes with the caramel/toffee malt. Hops offer grassy, earthy flavors that do work with the malt and with the buttery, fruity, dirty yeast to a lesser degree. Vague notes of citrus. A suggestion of leaves. Dry at the finish. Woody and sweet. Odd. Overall the palate is okay, it lacks richness what is there to sink my teeth into? Not much. Also, on what planet is this an IPA? I reviewed this bottle without this knowledge and my numbers are based on what I tasted. If I reviewed this as an IPA I would have ripped this beer. My point is this, there is nothing bad about the taste and there are good points too but there isnt anything special about it. Of course not every winter seasonal needs to be a high alcohol/spice/hopped beer; that is not what Im suggesting. This beer is okay. Just okay. Around medium in body, the carbonation is on the low side but the mouthfeel is still decent. It works. Sure, this beer is drinkable. Id have little problem drinking a six-pack of this. If this were a local beer Id buy it yearly. Its a simple but lovely quaff. Thanks ppoitras for the bottle, it was a welcomed addition to the 2004 Secret Santa!",2004-12-28,14050,Geary's Winter Ale

Definitely a strong sense of butterscotch. It's too bad, otherwise, the beer is quite nice. It starts out full-bodied, malty, and sweet, but ends with a decent hop bitterness.

Slightly hazy deep copper, requiring a vigorous pour to form a modest beige head with average retention and solid sheets of lacing. Carbonation is mild to moderate. Aroma is full of dates, raisins, prunes, and figs. Tons of sticky amber malts with minimal hops, yeast, and imperceptable alcohol aroma. Dripping gobs of vanilla and light honey pamper the nose. Very nice. Mouthfeel is smooth with a soft finish and despite the very malty nose, only has a medium body. Taste begins with moderate carbonation acidity, followed by herbal hops, then wierd stuff happens...the malty dates and raisins come out with no malt sweetness to back it up..there is an olfactory illusion, followed by semi-dry herbal bitterness, a wave of alcohol with mild fusels, and a kick in the pants with residual bubblegum. Toast is somewhere in the middle with a very brief caramel appearance towards the finish. Ringwood esters are barely noticeable. Most certainly not an IPA...more of a DAA (ya know, a double amber ale). Tastes like a Dogfish product because: 1)The yeast (which certainly has less diacetyl tones than DFH), 2)It's wierd, 3)It's not quite as good as you want it to be.

The mid-palette is much of the same wheatwine/old ale stuff, but not as sweet and backed by a loud pineapple hop backbone.

The big, foamy, soapy head dimples in a way that reminds me of a feather mattress. I take a sniff and wonder what I'm getting into; the hoppy, bitter scent is not unpleasant by any means, but it is slightly foreboding. It's one of those beers that smells astringent enough to make vague images of green plants spring to mind. I take one swallow, think ""Oh my! Lovely!"" and am irrevocably hooked. The taste is not only bloody huge, but marvelously drawn out. The first stage is big, heavy, carbonated, a little creamy, and above all malty. The middle is bitter and slightly fizzy. As the incredibly extended finish comes on, this bitterness becomes more austere, dry, and focused. The eruptions of lacing are an added bonus. I think this beer is poorly named; it's light years away from what I think of as winter ale. I don't care, though, because it's wonderful stuff.

Sweetish, with very distant butterscotch notes (if it's Ringwood, it's well controlled). I give the taste a 4.5 just because it's fun to figure out.

The flavour profile is straightforward, but beautifully balanced and quite enticing. Toffee and butterscotch sweetness start things off in familiar territory, with hints of citrus peel. The floral, leafy English hop bill struts its stuff in the latter half of the profile, providing a mildly bitter finish with notes of toasted nuts. Somewhat minerally aftertaste that rapidly fades from the palate. Light in body, with moderate carbonation levels that provide a nice, crisp mouthfeel that works perfectly with these particular hop flavours.  Final Grade: 4.11, an excellent A-. Brakspear Bitter is a fabulous session ale, and definitely one of the highlights of Marston's 'Classic Ales' sampler. This is not a complex beer, or even necessarily a particularly memorable one - but it's easily one of the best English bitters I've had in years, and for that reason I must give it some sincere props. Solid stuff that all English ale fans should consider worth a shot - I'd definitely be buying more if it were available in this province in a more convenient format.",2014-12-11,4064,Brakspear Bitter

4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Appearance – Dark golden amber in colour with a medium head that vanishes quickly and leaves little to zero lacing.

Smell – To be honest this Bitter smells a little of wet dog and chocolate but do not let that put you off! 

Taste – There is a depth of flavour in this one that is rather impressive. It starts off smooth at the front of the mouth but has bold bitter flavour on the back of the tongue. Coffee roasts like espresso with earthy hops and some notes of what I think may be citrus and toffee but it is hard to say because it is so dark and properly bitter that I drank this quickly enjoying it too much to really make notes on it properly. 

Mouthfeel – Wonderfully astringent yet smooth with good body. This went down a treat.

Overall – A very complex Bitter with a lot of character and a well-balanced, ever changing flavour. I liked this one a lot so I drank it almost forgetting to make my normal notes. If you want to try and rate a good bitter I recommend this one.",2014-09-15,4064,Brakspear Bitter

Surprisingly complex and flavorful, this is highly indicative of the English brewing style-- finding ways to create flavorful beers without having to jack up body and ABV. Toffee and caramel flavors explode in the mouth and finish with a earthy bitter twinge.

3.58,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,"Presentation-500ml brown pop top bottle with cool bumblebee cap. This beer is 3.4% abv, and has a best by date of October 31, 2011. The label says that this is brewed with the special ‘Double Drop’ system, and that it uses Maris Otter and English Goldings and Fuggles.  Appearance- Poured into a tulip pint, this brew pours a burnt orange/copper hue, which is capped by a nice ivory cap that fades after a minute or two to a thick, sticky film. All in all, a nice looking beer. Smell-Some apple-like fruity esters up front, with a bit of earthy English-variety hop, and light malty notes. Simple, but inviting. Taste-My initial thought was that this was overly light on flavor, but as the brew warms a bit, I think this initial impression may have been a bit harsh. It is light, but then again, this beer has only 3.4% alcohol, and the flavor that is there is, on the whole, pretty good. It starts out clean, with just a hint of fruity esters. A light, pale and crystal maltiness hits you next, and the finish is bracingly clean and bitter.  Conclusion-A pretty tasty bitter. At 3.4%, this would make one really nice quaffable (true) session ale. The bitterness is still just a bit high for me, in that (for me) it overtakes the malt just a bit too much. I like my bitters fairly balanced, if leaning towards the bitter side. Still, this one isn’t bad at all.",2011-08-05,4064,Brakspear Bitter
4.32,4.0,4.5,4.0,5.0,4.5,"500 mL bottle purchased in Cambridge, UK in May 2011, brought back to the US and opened in July. The minute I popped the bottle, I was transported back to the UK.  In the glass, it's a handsome copper-amber with a nice glow. Little head retention, but I don't care -- it makes it look like a cask pull! On the nose, wonderful hints of toast, brown sugar, faint fuggles, and lots of florals. The taste is a perfectly balanced maltiness with a fine bitter snap to finish. Just a hint of butter in there, but it's neither distracting nor detracting. It possesses the perfect balance of oily coating and spritzy scrubbing-bubbles.  At 3.4%, it's the model of a well-balanced, superbly crafted session ale, and proof that high strength is no prerequisite for a great beer. The maltiness leans a bit heavy, but I've no serious complaints. All round, an extremely agreeable Bitter and a pleasant companion for the evening.

A coppery-amber colour with slight haziness and medium carbonation. Produces a decent off-white head that lasts for a few minutes before collapsing to leave a surface film. Aroma is malty with an underlying sweetness. Notes of roasted malt, toffee and caramel. A hint of hops. A smooth malt taste with a nice balance of sweet and bitter flavours. Hints of roasted malt accompanied by notes of toffee, citrus and burnt grain. A subtle hoppy bitteness makes for a dry finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, with a crisp tingly sensation.

At first, the taste is full of hoppy bitterness with a mouth-feel of carbonation. However, as the carbonation goes down the taste becomes more mellow to the tongue, and the light bitterness goes up to the palate. Their is a lovely tone of dried fruit, as well as a hint of honey in the after-taste. This brew is rather drinkable, due to the mellow taste and a low alcohol content.

3.26,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,"A fusion of lemon yellow, maple beige and tawny amber are glossed over with a coating of mahogany. There is a very thin but existent level of white, bubbly head. Lacing present. Leisurely schools of bubbles are observed in spurts, taking their time on the vertical path upwards. This is a beer meant for holding up to the light.  The aroma smells, to be quite frank, like beer that has sat in an opened bottle over night. The must of damp cardboard, rotting cork, and steaming vegetables make for smells as unpleasant as they are unexpected. First and foremost, however, is the stark and unappealing smell of cheap, buttery toffee.  The beer is badly lacking in flavour and texture. It is a common complaint I have with the British bitters that are shipped to North America; they loose their taste and their essence. If this were unpasteurized, unfiltered, and fresh ... then I'd have an entirely different beer in front of me. It is that simple. I imagine it would be quenching and tasteful. I assume it would taste (and drink) as it was designed to.  Instead, I have a nearly full pint I'm trying to avoid drinking. The soft, honeyed biscuit malts and light sprinkle of toffee are instead an astringent, dry, buttery mess of cheap caramel and cardboard. It is lifeless. It is tasteless, bland, bloating, and least of all: it is far far from something I could drink all night.  I have had a few good offerings I enjoyed from Brakspear. But this beer, a 3.5% well malted bitter, was nothing like what it should be. I will try to avoid a rant before it begins by saying anyone who's been to England and had true bitters, that is to say unpasteurized, unfiltered and fresh off cask, can attest that these imports are a ghost of the real selves.

4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"The Henley brewery is now closed. This brown 500ml bottle claims to be brewed in 'England for Tillverkare The Brakspear brewing Co'. Best before April 2008, drank on a wet cold July 2007 evening in my front room. I poured the bottle into one of my Duvel glasses. It looked great, a good solid foaming head, slightly off white. The beer was a lovely deep terracotta red. The aroma was of hops, malts and some barley tones too, a typical English bitter smell. Nothing very strong, but there if you search for it. Considering the 3.4 ABV, this is a very good beer, the soft roundness often found in English bitters is here in an abundance. A kind of understated fruitiness is also to be found. This is a well balanced beer, not sweet or sour, just a pleasant session beer, ideal for an afternoon in a beergarden on one of those rare sunny days we have during an English summer.",2007-07-20,4064,Brakspear Bitter

The initial taste is almost of apple juice with the bitterness kicking in after a few seconds. But, I'm sorry to say, I found it very watery and on the flat side (but then why not? It's a low-alcohol English bitter). The aftertaste is not so bad although the as a whole I think the product begs for another percent ABV.",2007-05-20,4064,Brakspear Bitter

4.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5.0,"The smallest Bitter I've ever encountered, either as an import or otherwise. Pours a very clear-to-brilliant golden copper in color, leaving a light tan/off white head of small dense bubbles. Medium duration on the head, about two and a half minutesto deflate adter a modrate pour. Good lacing. The nose says it all, with a bitterness that is usually less pronounced in this style. There's plenty of biscuity malt and a mild herbal/vegetal character here too, but the hops are mugging for all the good shots here. The first sip gives you an idea of what you're in for: bitter and astringent, a touch of lactic sourness, and very attenuated malt sweetness right around the middle. Light-bodied and with a light and breezy mouthfeel, but this is both on-style and perfect for this brew. Wonderful aromatics here, with equal parts malt and hop. As this warms the vegetal/fruity character I detected in the nose really develops and makes something of a ""Star Turn"", complementing the lingering bitterness quite beautifully. Biscuity malt also kicks around looking a bit like an unloved supporting cast member, but it can't be entirely forgotten here. An absolutely wonderful drink! If only there were more like this readily available in the U.S. - hop-bombers, are you listening? (Edit: I first encountered this as part of the old All Saint's Brands import portfolio, and was positively ecstatic to see it return via Shelton Brothers - naturally, the brewery closed soon after! May or may not be brewed by the good folks at Wychwood . . . I sure hope so!)",2007-01-12,4064,Brakspear Bitter

S: earthy and floral scent of hops plus a grapefruit zest note, like Fuggles-dominated hop content. Simple and nice. T: lightly-sour sweet maltiness underlined by a profound spicy and herbal hops, followed by a dryish zesty kick at the back; very smooth finish with a moderate bitterness which lingers surprisingly well~~ M&amp;D: the soft mouthfeel is consistently backed by subtle and fine carbonation--very good cask-conditioned; light-bodied, simple-flavoured, this is a good honest bitter to savour--could use bolder flavour to really stand out, though.",2006-04-04,4064,Brakspear Bitter

The musty malts, caramel, and light floral hops mix well to offer the drinker a rather substantial nose. Taste  The toasted malts pick up a bit of wood at the taste along with, oddly enough, some alcohol notes. The sharp citrus hops and hints of sour and tart round things out at the finish. Mouthfeel  Light to medium-bodied and tangy with a good bitter character.

3.74,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,"Found this at Manchester Wine &amp; Spirits in CT. Poured out a light copper/amber color with a very little head that went to lacing all the way until the end. Smell consisted of malts, biscuits, buttery tones and some soft fruit. Blended well together actually. Taste was good, but the mouthfeel was quite flat. Perhaps a bad bottle but it was pretty flat. But the taste held up nicely. British brewed beers usually like to be on the low side of carbonation so perhaps that's what the beer is supposed to be but I didn't like it that way. Other than that not a bad bitter.",2004-08-10,4064,Brakspear Bitter

Begins dry with flour-coated bread crusts. Buttery hues add depth and character. Never attains any real sweetness, but toffee, caramel and apple skins are suggested. High pH water, makes this hard and brittle in the mouth. Hopping is light, but adds both lilac and herbal bitterness. A bit of dried tobacco on the swallow.  Nicely constructed!

The body is much more syrupy than I expected from the listed alcohol content of 3.4%, and it has a nicely balanced malt sweetness and a very fruity, hoppy flavor initially. The finish comes quickly and consists of a medium dry, bright, clean, hop bitterness over a slightly grainy taste.  This is an interestingly refreshing beer.

3.25,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,"Poured a fairly standard amber but not a lot of character. Didn't have that glow I like in a beer that's pale enough to see through. The head was nice and slow to fade, though. The nose was surprisingly hoppy as was the flavor. Since the body was really thin the abundant hopping was forced to carry the beer. Unfortunately, the hops (Goldings, according to Oakes at least) don't have enough flavor and character besides the bitterness and a slight medicinal quality to add much excitement. Although the malt there was nice, like buttered caramel, there wasn't enough of it. Not bad, just not good. Easily quaffable though.",2003-02-17,4064,Brakspear Bitter

4.34,3.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,5.0,"Presentation: 500 ml brown bottle with a BB (Best Before) date jet printed on the neck of the bottle. Appearance: Thin and inattentive off white lace that barely stays around. This ale is very clear with a bright shaded orangey copper hue. Smell: Soft fruity and buttery aroma, some plum and lemon jump out amongst the stable malty nose. Faint woody hop in the nose behind the malt and yeast. Taste: Moderate body with a supple smoothness, carbonation flows over the palate and prepares the tastes buds. A light maltiness cradles a growing hop presence with light bready and caramel tones. Hops evolve quickly on to the palate with a solid bitterness and lingering earthy and woody flavour. Yeast hands off a fruitiness that adds some serious depth to the brew, other than the mild buttery diacetyl it is quite a clean ale. Finishes dry with a lingering earthy hoppiness. Notes: Quite an impressive little ale at 3.4% abv, the head retention has its problems but on a whole this is a stellar bitter. It was worth the 3.99 (I personally would not pay more) a pop and an ale to go back to when I crave a refreshing bitter.",2002-09-04,4064,Brakspear Bitter

Rustic, leafy, dry - hopped, earthy Fuggles hop nose hits the nose upfront, &amp; is ensued by biscuit malt, light caramel and mild diacetyl butterscotch. The malt profile is a seemless extension of the aroma, being comprised of biscuit &amp; light buttery diacetyl, w/ malt sweetness provided by light crystal malt. Hop bitterness offsets malt sweetness perfectly, lending an overall balance to this bitter. Ample residual dextrins provide a full body, &amp; when coupled with the low carbonation, the mouthfeel is slickly smooth. Assertively British, earthy Fuggles hop flavor.

Finishes with a medium bitterness and some toffee-covered walnuts lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a light/medium body and medium carbonation. Nothing spectacular, but a solid English Bitter that's a bit on the malty, fruity, nutty side, balanced by lighter grassy herbal hops.

Flavor includes a slightly buttery malt sweetness accompanied by a tinny hop bitterness; spicy, woody hops follow along with a light, apple-like fruitiness. Soft carbonation provides a fairly light body; texture is just a little bit dry and watery; finish leaves a chalky sensation. 

Could be better, though I don't want to write this one off as all-around bad. It's smooth, thirst quenching, sessionable.

3.14,3.75,3.5,2.75,2.75,3.5,"Appearance: Poured with a finger and a half of head that retained quite well and left some lacing behind. The body is a malty orange colour that boasts very low carbonation. Smell: Dry caramel malt takes a back seat to floral and herbal hops. Warming helped it out slightly, but not massively. Taste: Not really sure what they were trying to do here, I mean it starts with some very tightly reigned in caramel malt that comes across as incredibly tame and then turns a peculiar dusting of light floral and herbal hops then produce a slight bitter kick. Nothing offensive, it's just...well a bit bland. I get it's an English Bitter and it's supposed to be light, but there's just too little there. Mouthfeel: The transitioning is a little weird, and the low carbonation doesn't do it any favours but the very mild malt aftertaste somewhat mitigates these issues. However it's a little bit dry. Drinkability: Well it's refreshing but that's probably because it's so tame. I mean it's easy to drink and settles down nicely, but honestly, it's a little boring. Final Thoughts: I got this in a pack for Christmas from my brother, and sadly the best brew out of that pack was Wychwood's flagship beer Hobgoblin. This beer has put me in the position of not wanting to try any more Wychwood products, save for maybe King Goblin, since I would hope it would be similar to Hobgoblin. Apart from Hobgoblin and Fiddler's Elbow, I've been very disappointed with this brewery as of late. This stuff is average at best, and you will want to pass.",2014-03-30,4526,Goliath

Taste: some of the earth malts and an almost fug-like toffee to go with it. A bit awkward, and very dull. Aftertaste: the flavours fade away pretty quickly, really just not much there. Mouth feel: a moderate body with a lower carbonation, suits the style. Perhaps a touch more carbonation would bring some more flavours through. Overall: a pretty boring English Bitter.

But Goliath was dwarfed in comparrison to Hobgoblin. I pourd it into my Hobgoblin glass, and the colour was a nice orange brown colour and very clear. The head was about one finger in size and lingered on for the most part of the beers consumption, but whithered away by the end of the beer. It tasted very light and watery, kind of bitter though near the end. All and all it did what it said on the bottle it ""slayed my thirst"" and it wasn't unpleasent, it seemed as if I could drink a bunch of these and not feet too lousy.

Light hop notes and some sweetness, although something feels a bit off here (touch of skunkiness?). Taste has English malts, bread and a bit of bitterness, lightly earthy and some sweetness as per the nose. Medium light feel, slick carbonation and some residual hops and malt sweetness after each sip. A touch of butter also. Easy to drink, if not the most flavourful of beers.

The is also a cookie/cereal taste and a bit of a pear juice sweetness. The beer finishes with a malty/caramel aftertaste with some light lingering hop bitterness.

Overall, more to style as the bottle would suggest as an amber ale than BAs English Pale classification. Much nicer bottle label and brown glass bottle as well perhaps hinting at a recipie change for this beer has since happened.

3.48,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,"The beer's crisp orange-ish colour lies somewhere between pumpkin tone and that of the changing leaves. Either way, it beckons the fall. Transparency is observed only at the base of the glass, where the complexion is its lightest, as all other parts are too deeply shaded in. Although it fails to leave any lace, its head sticks around for the entirety of the tasting. Both malt and hops appear in their naked state; the malts grainy and the hops grassy. Wychwood seems to release so many of these plain-ish beers that you'd swear they wrote the damn formula for them. The nose doesn't give you anything to get excited about, but it does provide a assuring glimpse of what's to ensue: a simple, but well-crafted ale.  Most flavour is derived primarily from the crystal malts, which impart an almost Märzen-like chewy, bready, toasty maltiness. The dry but reasonably sweet finish and the significant carbonate content both enhance the Oktoberfest aspect of it. Pungent, floral, garden-variety English hops confuse the issue, but are less impressionable than the malts.  I'm not sure there's any sense in calling a 4.2% beer 'Goliath' (especially as it was David who slayed Goliath - proofread the write-ups on the back of your labels, Wychwood.) But they are right about one thing: this grainy, somewhat watery ale does do the trick in terms of alleviating thirst. It lends itself to big gulps and disappears from the glass in no time.  This brewery has succeeded once again in crafting a pleasant but ordinary beer. If brewing awards were given out for mediocrity, Wychwood would have a tone of trophies on their shelf. Mind you, that's not to take anything away from them. Who doesn't enjoy a straightforward pint of plain, agreeable ale time to time? Many drinkers enjoy nothing more.",2011-09-24,4526,Goliath

Mild yet malty aroma with a ripened fruit tone that reminds me of white grapes. Has a definite toasted character to it. Malt forward taste with a strong grape or cherry-like fruit tone. Somewhat surprising alcohol taste comes through in the bitter finish along with a metallic or mineral-like quality. Rather thin mouthfeel with a moderate carbonation level. Nice, creamy sensation on the tongue with a slightly yeasty character. Aftertaste is dry with a grainy quality. This is a great light and bitter session ale in my books, though a bit lacklustre compared to other Wychwood/Marston's offerings.

S: Sweet, somewhat bready caramel malts with musty yeast, floral, faintly spicy hops, and a variety of fruity notes - namely pear, orange, and a hint of lemon - all with a definite buttery character. Intriguing. T: Musty yeast and robust caramel malts start off slightly sweet but eases off to show bready, grainy notes. Peppery and earthy (a bit herbal and a bit woodsy) hops with clean, lingering bitterness towards the swallow, joined by smooth, buttery overtones. Fruit notes are weak compared to the nose, but the hops bring out hints of orange zest on the swallow. M: Medium-bodied with lively carbonation, crisp and prickly in the mouth but never gassy. The hop bitterness balances the flavour profile well and lingers long enough to encourage a follow-up sip, without becoming an aftertaste. Refreshing and satisfying. D: Fragrant, flavourful, and sessionable, the Goliath strikes me as an unorthodox English pale ale in a good way.

Light amber-copper, leaves behind an inch of foam that survives as a thick half-moon for the entirety of the pint. Lots of sticky lacing as well. Nose is sweet malt, Fuggles/Goldings, caramel and orange. Not bad. Not a bad brew by any stretch, but the medicinal mineral finish to certain English pales is starting to try my patience. I can quaff it just fine, but I feel its missing a more robust malt character, and the hops aren't doing much to salvage things.  The aftertaste is medicinal and herbal - not terribly pleasant. Medium-light bodied, average carbonation. Long bitter/herbal finish. A miss for me. A brew named ""Goliath"" deserves better than the standard EPA treatment.

The carbonation is on the low side, the body an easygoing medium weight, and commensurately smooth. It finishes fairly dry, that weird edgy medicine essence rearing back up.

3.48,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,"Appearance: Sits hazzily in the clear bottle and pours out a slightly less cloudy than expected medium copper body with a fine white head that sticks around and leaves a bit of lacing Smell: After the initial skunk passed by, the overwhelming aroma is of butterscotch diacetyl and caramel Taste: The initial flavor is of malty butterscotch, though not overly sweet; about midway through, the hops kick in and provide some astringency that sticks through to the finish, where the butterscotch re-asserts itself Mouthfeel: A bit thick and slick; moderate carbonation Drinkability: I find that English Pale Ales each have their own personality, somewhat like the dotty characters that appear on the BBC imports; this one is certainly different and while drinkable, is not something I would seek out very often",2005-09-05,4526,Goliath

They've got that whole ""mystical thing"" going on, which is kind of cute I guess. But if they put a little more of that energy into making the beer, then perhaps we'd have something more interesting. AND FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, START USING BROWN BOTTLES!!!",2005-07-18,4526,Goliath
2.97,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.5,3.0,Found in 660ml clear glass bottle. Was a bit wary because of the clear glass and was assaulted as expected once opened. Very strong skunking in this one. Luckily though after about 5 minutes or so it dissapated enough for me to pick up a few other notes from the brew. Colorwise a nice clear copper-gold hue. Moderate to no head what was dropped to a slight lace ring about 1 minute later. Decent maltiness with appropriate bitterness for the style. All in all would be a good brew if found on tap or anything but these vile clear glass bottles thay Wychwood always seems to use in those version found here in the states.,2005-04-16,4526,Goliath

Moderate in body with a rather creamy texture. Taste begins with the sweetness of English malts followed by notes of bread dough and a bit of roasted nuttiness.

3.42,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,I was afraid of this upon first glance of that clear bottled import. Indeed I had to practically leave the room when I popped the top on this guy. The skunk never did subside but it did diminish. The appearance was a beautiful golden hue with not too much of a head as is to be expected. It was not over-hopped (although my olefactory system was not in prime working order due to the skunk). I would like to give this fabled Ale a fair shake in England someday without the spector of sun-exposure looming over all my senses. I did enjoy the ale and polished it off in short order earning it subjective high marks for drinkability.,2004-05-04,4526,Goliath
3.31,4.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,"I was concerned that this beer may be skunked because of the clear 660 ml bottle, but when I opened it I found no evidence of skunk in the aroma. It poured a very clear brownish red and had a nice thick off white head that lasted for a long while. The aroma was mild. I detected a little earthiness and some malt but no hops. The taste as with the aroma was all malt. I found no hoppiness. Their website claimed ""the elegant citrus taste is perfectly balanced by a strong crisp bitterness"" but I found no citrus at all nor was their strong crisp bitterness. Maybe I have grown too accustomed to the hoppiness of the Northwest.  The mouthfeel was not quite medium and as the style should there was no carbonation on the tongue. I will buy this beer again.

It's medium-light body and fine, restrained carbonation leaves it lightly crisp on the tongue at first before warming to become softer and smooth in the swallow. Yeasty fruitiness (apple, pear, berries) appears clearly in the flavor, and combines with its buttery diacetyl and some citrusy/grassy/floral/earthy hops to lend a great deal of character to it's nutty, caramel kissed malt. A firm bitterness balances and lends an edge to the finish once the sweetness of the malt has had its time to shine. It finishes with some residual malt and a bit of earthy &amp; leafy hops (or is coming from a combination with the slight residual sulphur?) that step aside to let the bitterness dry things out.

Creamy pancake like lace that clings to the glass very well, mild chill haze goes a way but not totally after the sunset orange amber hued brew warms up. Smooth with a flowing crispness, moderate body and a full rush of carbonation. Citric and almost cidery on top with a growing under belly of musty buttery diacetyl. Maltiness is sweet but there is enough hop bitterness to counter act and balance. Fruity with odd pear and apple flavours. Bit of earthy character from the yeast and hops with a fairly clean and dry grainy finish. An easy drinking ale to say the least, quick jabs of malt, hops and yeast by-products keep the palate in check.

There's also a good dose of caramel and some light, earthy hops. The hops make a stronger showing in the taste with a gentle bitterness and a mix of floral, earthy and grassy flavors with a touch of citrus peel. The beer is drier than expected, which is a pleasant surprise. It has a clean, rich malt character that steps aside to let the hops balance things out. Very easy to drink. Relatively low carbonation.

Taste has the same flavors the smell did initially but they don't last long. Those taste are smokey, roasted flavors but the bitter or almost sour flavor overcomes the tongue very rapidly. It kind of leaves the palate with a lacquer or wood stain taste. Mouth is crisp and almost spritzy. Body is light and the finish is dry and very average.

The flavor was interrupted by a blast of carbonation I was not expecting. The tingle hit the mouth right as my lips had waded through the mass of foam which had no ambition to recede. Not a bad thing however. The flavor that emerged had an excellent dry hop presence, making me want another sip immediately.

3.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,"A huge thanks to Chris for a couple Marshall beers at DLD 12oz. bottle poured into a nonic pint glass. It pours a semi-clear burnt orange with a head that starts really rich and dense but dies quickly into a small layer of bubbles. The smell is loaded with bready, toasty malt smells with some caramel smells thrown in there. I'm also getting just a little floral type hops but not much. The taste has a nice amount of toasted sweet bread to it. There is also just a little bit of spiciness to it. I'm not sure if its the hop taste or the yeast that is the culprit but it's pretty minor. The finish is slightly bitter and then some English yeast fruitiness as well thrown in. The mouthfeel seems pretty full bodied with a low to medium amount of carbonation, it's really smooth and excellent drinkability. This beer would really shine on cask.",2010-05-12,43171,McNellie's Pub Ale

Aromas of cider, priming sugar, whiff of rubber or latex. Smells like our first homebrew. Tastes.... dusty. Sweet throughout, like a honey wheat bread. Hops are earthy, soapy and short lived. Body is quite light, almost watery. Alcohol is minimal. Would not get this again. Looking at the later reviews, this might have been a bad batch.",2010-04-06,43171,McNellie's Pub Ale

Yeah, I'm getting a little bit of that, strangely enough. Is this really a bitter? Flavor is nice and subtle with caramel and biscuit malt, earthiness, and grassy and floral hops. Slightly bitter on the finish. The Belgian yeast notes also appear in the flavor, along with some fruitiness, maybe apple or citrus. Medium body and average carbonation. Nothing special on the mouthfeel really. Definitely a sessionable one, as it is very drinkable (and I don't know the ABV, but I don't care, session beer purists).

Smell was very floral, I swear I got notes of apple in the nose, and some hops were up front and present. in the taste, the hops are there, a nice bittering, and some subtle spice. full of flavor, this beer rules in the taste department. well balanced. it's a light bodied beer and quite fizzy, i thought it was almost too high in carbonation. feels awesome in the mouth.

Toasty biscuit-like malt carries the taste with a sharp, almost coarse, bitterness and a touch of fruity and spicy hop flavor. A little bit of caramel character softens it up some. Overall, a decent ale. It's quite a bit different than most of the bitters I've had in England, but nonetheless it's a decent, flavorful pint.",2010-02-24,43171,McNellie's Pub Ale
4.05,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.0,4.5,"Dropped this one at James E McNellie's in Tulsa about a month ago. Is this the McNellie's pub to which the beer's name refers? Maybe our OK BA's would know better. This came in a Guinness pint glass and was honey-colored, almost orange in fact, with copper tones. Murkier than I would have expected, but I like that. A finger of fine white foam that left intricate lacing topped it off, but didn't stay around for long. Hops presented in the nose, with familiar scents of citrus and pine most prominent. This didn't exactly jump out of the glass, but perhaps some of that's to blame on the pour. This was a very very smooth beer with an integrated flavor to it. This is what is meant by a session beer, I'm sure. Soft fruity highlights accompanied the pine and citrus hops - my wife insists there was a cherry taste in there and I think she was right. I found this to be rather thin, with a very light and brief mouth coating giving way to a clean finish. Not bad at all, just sort of a weak way to end the gulp. Unfortunately this was very weakly carbonated and served underchilled. I know mild carbonation is a hallmark of the style, but this was bordering on flat. The beer or the bar? I don't know. That compromised my overall enjoyment, but I'm giving Marshall the benefit of the doubt on this one. The flavor was great and had a smoothness to which I'm unaccustomed. Will look for this again to see if the carbonation problem is a chronic one.",2010-02-10,43171,McNellie's Pub Ale
4.26,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Slightly hazy copper colored brew with a generous long-lasting creamy head Minimal aroma but the flavor makes up for it. Rich malty goodness with a tiny hint of chocolate, dirt (not in a bad way, but like how good garden dirt smells), a little of coffee and a little bit of cream. A nice background of hops, but not too much. Excellent balance! So, so smooth in the mouth. Wonderful fluffy yet substantial texture. Easy to drink. Highly recommend this beer.

3.98,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass. The beer is a cloudy copper color, and the first pour gives me a magnificent two finger off-white head. As I take my first few drinks, the head leaves large notches on the glass. S: A good amount of fruit in the nose. Bready notes, along with just a touch of citrus hops.  T: My first impressions are earthy, caramel candies, and hops come in more in the end. I was cooking dinner while drinking, and I walked away and came back to it about ten minutes later. The bitterness had kicked into overdrive and it was quite a pleasant suprise. M: Medium body, thin carbonation. D: Such a smoooth drinker. Flavorful, rich, but with a low enough ABV to be able to go a few rounds. Also, this beer is a great value @ $4.99 for a 22oz bomber. An outstanding price for a beer this good!

3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A great introduction to the Marshall Brewing Company. A standard, solid, and inviting beer that offends no one yet should be comforting to all. The pour brings a solid copper color with mild haze. Above average on head formation, retention, and lacing of creamy off-white foam. Maltiness is the leading character that pushes the beer from nose to finish. Crisp graham cracker sweetness, breadiness, and grains give a moderate level of sweetness, breadiness, caramel, and body. Hops are earthy and take a while to balance but finally does just before the finish. Quite English with the delicate, floral, earthy character. Estery with cherries and apples give a little more variety to the beer, keeping it from becomming all about the malts. Carbonation is light, emulating the creaminess and efforvescence of cask ales- a worthwile adjustment. Otherwise the beer fades into a minty dryness and a waining residual caramel sweetness. A nice English Ale that I'll be happy to drink any day. Thanks again BlueOkie!",2010-01-08,43171,McNellie's Pub Ale

M - creamy, almost velvety body. Low carbonation. T - cider initially with rich malt body. Cider goes away as the beer warms leaving a nice rich caramel malt body.

2.74,2.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,Served in a standard pint glass with a full off-white head that dissipated fairly soon thereafter. Appearance was off-white to sallow and completely opaque. Asked the barserver if it was always this cloudy and was told it must be the bottom of the barrel where the alcohol is higher and other stuff. Made perfect sense to me? Smell was average and beery with nothing distinctive. Taste was flat and thin with a hint of toffee. Finish was acidic with only a slight floral bitterness. An average brew that I wouldn't care to try again unless it was from a newly tapped keg and wasn't overly cloudy. Hopefully that was the reason for the unremarkable taste.,2009-12-03,43171,McNellie's Pub Ale

Appearance: Slightly hazy burnt orange beer capped with a HUGE, slightly soapy large-bubbled head with good retention...there's a bit more carbonation than belongs in a bitter IMO.  Smell: Light dry bready malts, somewhat crackery, with a bit of yeasty fruitiness in the background; hops actually aren't that obvious, and there's just a bit of sweet cereal-like graininess...simple, but not unpleasant Taste: Some dry caramel malts, light graininess as well, a fairly good dose of hop bitterness, some mild leafy herbal hops...it's fairly dry and refreshing, and the bitterness is punchy and pleasant. The finish has a touch of tea-like bitterness and some leafy, resiny, and woodsy hops. Not a ton going on, but nice.

3.71,4.5,3.5,3.5,5.0,3.5,"Beer number three today on my annual Friday fall fridge frolic. Same fat tulip glass, same comfy chair.  Another wax top courtesy of russpowell. :) The open bottle smokes for a bit as I wait on the microwave to deliver my breakfast. Turbid/creamy pour, settles into an appetizing dark &amp; cloudy rust/honey brown beer. An inch of velvet-soft, cream-colored head lays on top like a throw pillow. Cheerio/Mini-Wheats sort of smell wafting off the top. A little carmelization &amp; very light chocolate. Sweaty, mild semi-citrus hops, pleasant doughiness. I'm anticipating a sweet red ale. First thing I notice, is the carbonation is way lower then the previous Marshall beer I just had. There is a constant froth, a build up of body, that delivers more of a meal, &amp; less of a sizzle then I was expecting. Taste is big on dry biscuits &amp; earthy, though calm &amp; considerate hops. Some charred malt in there, bittering up what the hops gave up in favor of position. Barely peppery, &amp; tasting of some ash. Flavor is drawn a little thin, bit the earthy/dirty qualities seem to fill the gaps some. Slightly itchy malt, seemingly calcified water makes the style pretty obvious. Alcohol is pretty negligible. Feel, more then the actual flavor is what sells it. A quencher with quite decent flavor too. :)",2009-09-25,43171,McNellie's Pub Ale

3.98,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,Poured from 22oz bottle that I got in a LIF win from thehand (I think).  A- Poured a very nice semi-hazy copper color. The bottle had some sediment in the bottom of it which I did not pour. Good one finger tan head which dies down a little and left some decent lacing on the sides of the glass.  S- This has some nice bittering hops in the nose of this beer. I smell a lot of sweeter malts though which bring this up to par. The malts lean more toward a toffee and sweet caramel more than anything. Smells interesting...lets hope it tastes as good as it smells! T- This is really well...good and balanced. The malts come through with this from the get go. Lightly roasted which I missed in the nose along with the hints of toffee and a deep caramel taste. The bittering hops comes through and balance out the beer very well. I couldn't have expected more to be honest.  M- Nice medium-light mouthfeel to this beer. Nice malt overtones on the palate with a slight bitter hop leave for a semi-sweet coating on the tounge after you take a sip. Good bitterly sweet aftertaste that makes you want to drink more. M- This was quite the suprise beer for me to drink. It is quite smooth and actually makes you want to drink more of it after the bottle is gone. I could make this a everyday drinker if it was readily available to me. Kind of sad that this beer isn't.,2009-09-02,43171,McNellie's Pub Ale

It surely would have been nice if Marshall Brewing Company had been open when I lived in Tulsa a while ago. Very well done beer. Pours a somewhat hazy amber with a decent head that sticks around for a bit. Smells somewhat light and yeasty, but with a nice, dry, biscuity smell in the background. Tastes very clean and restrained with good, typical English malt notes. Slightly biscuity, soft and with a subtle earthy bitterness. Soft on the palate up front, but with just enough dry bitterness to give it some snap at the end. Really a very well made beer.

4.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.0,"Poured from a 22oz bomber with a green wax seal into a pint glass. No dating info. It was a ruby tinged amber color with amazing amount of carbonation and great lacing. It had a large tan head that ever so slowly settled into a constant thick foam fed by the carb. The aroma was floral hops with some citric hops as well as toasted malt and caramel. Only had a few English Bitters and this has one of the best aromas. Really good sniffer. The taste was good but not on par with the aroma. Starts out with a carb attack and then settles into a nice malty middle till the bitter from the hops kick in and finish it with a nice mild bitter bite. Goes down quite smooth. Nice break from the hops bombs and stouts I've had lately. Only major complaint is the carb levels. It is extremely over-carbonated. The beginning of each drink starts with a carb attack on the lips and tongue. And after a couple drinks, I have to rip some good burbs to relieve the gas buildup. Hurts the drinkability. Overall, an excellent English Bitter that I highly recommend. I can see why it's #4 in that style as of this reviewing. Not available here but I can easily get when I visit the in-laws in Oklahoma. Need to try on tap. [good]",2009-07-25,43171,McNellie's Pub Ale

Aroma starts with some citrus and grassy hops and a decent toasted caramel malt presence as well. There are also hints of light fruits in there that lend a faint sweetness to the aroma. The taste again has an impressive hop presence up front, lots of citrus and some grassy undertones. The toasted malt presence forms a solid backbone and the finish is bitter with hops and lightly sweet with fruits. The mouthfeel is lively with strong carbonation and dry in the finish.

4.1,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,"Bottle coutesy of thehand - thanks! Nice extra. Poured into a 22 oz. Terrapin snifter, probably not the most appropriate glassware, but it fits the whole bomber!! Appearance: Interesting presentation - a wax-dipped 22 oz. bomber for a 5% abv english bitter!? Unique, I'll take it. Pours a surprisingly deep, ruby-tinged auburn, hazy, capped by a good, healthy finger of off-white head. The retention is actually surprisingly good, fading slowly and leacing some nice swaths of sticky, even lacing and a big, thick collar and sheen. Carbonation - that is, what carbonation is visible through the haze - is about average speed and relatively sparse. Aroma: Very malt forward and full - toast, toffee, strong caramel, even some faint hints of chocolate - but with a nice accompaniment of leafy hops. Hops aren't as assertive here as they are in the mouth, however, but that's alright - the malt complexities are enough to carry the party here. Taste: A very balanced brew. The malt backbone is heavily roasted and slightly nutty, with hints of toffee, caramel, and slight toast. The hop bitterness is moderate but definitely noticeable, and is accompanied by some slightly citrusy, slightly grassy and spicy hop notes. There's also a definite fruity note, not dark, but not light and estery either - it's grapelike, almost, pleasant. It's both distinctly American and distinctly traditional at the same time.  Mouthfeel: A relatively thin-bodied beer, appropriate for the style, with a healthy amount of carbonation that makes for a fairly large, perhaps slightly too large, but even and both crisp and creamy mouthfeel. Soft effervescence. Drinkability: A well-made and extremely sessionable brew at 5.0%, this one was quite a pleasant surprise. I'd love to try this one on cask, too - seems that cask ale was sort of made for this kind of brew.

4.1,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,"Marshall's McNellie's Pub Ale pours up sublime from the sparkler of beer engine creating a cascading effect as the carbonation releases thousands of tiny bubbles creating a finely condensed, lacy creamish-white head that perfectly crowns the slightly hazy, gamboge-tawny copper colored body. The clarity becomes brighter as the beer warms. The hoppy (grassy, earthy) aroma shows some fruitiness (lemon zest, orange peel, grapefruit) which is complimented by some lightly toasted caramel maltiness. The alcohol warmth is nearly negligible. Clean, no diacetyl or other off-flavors. The light hoppy flavor starts off with a touch of breadiness &amp; some caramel maltiness that eventually gives way to a pleasant earthy bitterness that never completely dominates the dryish, fruity, well-balanced finish. This medium-light bodied, unfiltered Premium Bitter is wonderfully creamy from the beer engine with just the perfect amount of carbonation. There's just a touch of grainy astringency from the domestic pale malt. This is an extremely drinkable English-style session beer that delivers enough hops to keep even the most discriminating beer lover's interest. It sure is nice to have some real ale back on draught in T-Towne. McNellie's Cask Pub Ale can be found on draught at James E. McNellie's Public House (Side Bar).

In the bottle, this beer is very good, probably getting a solid A- on the ratings. However, in real ale form, it is outstanding, A+ The beer is served with a dense, rocky, tan head. The color is a clear copper/red. The smell is deeply of earthy hops. Incredibly rich and complex. The beer is served at the perfect temperature, around 55 degrees Fahrenheit. The first thing you taste is the wonderfully rich malt. It has hints of toffee and bread. Next, a hint of English Ale yeast strain. Finally, the earthy hops in the finish. The hop flavor is slightly more American than English, but that doesn't really matter, it is fantastic. Mouthfeel is amazingly rich, PERFECT carbonation that is incredibly soft. Drinkability is OFF THE CHARTS. I only drank one pint (wasn't sure if it was a 16 or 20oz) as I had to drive home afterward, but if I wasn't driving, I would have had many of these.

4.1,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,"Had this at the McNellie's 1st Annual Craft Beer Festival in Tulsa. Jotted down some notes on the back of a Rogue coaster, amongst a few weird/curious looks.  Poured a rusty copperish-brown into a sample mug.  Smell involved a good balance of hops, sweet malts and some furtive citruses, while it tasted of various spices mixed with caramel and an essence of tea, all of which made for a fulfilling session brew.  This is a light to medium bodied, smooth and very drinkable debut beer that should be a good  sign of things to come. ___ 7/16/09. Returned to McNellies for an evening out and a concert, and was excited to try this brew on cask, and in the proper nonic glassware this time. Was light brown with cherry hues at the edges. The tan head faded slowly into a decent leftover froth. The brew is smooth anyway, but ultra-smooth, highly drinkable and satisfying served like this.  I recently read where McNellies actually loses money by serving this beer, and that is a sad state of affairs, so if you're ever at McNellies in Tulsa or OKC, have a couple of these and support cask beer in Oklahoma.",2008-06-13,43171,McNellie's Pub Ale

Appearance - a yellowy golden color with incredible amounts of haze. A nice finger of white heads sits on top and lingers for a short while. Smell - some light fruits and some malty aromas. A gentle leafy hop presence. Not a big nose. Taste - some fruitiness with dark fruits, minimal malts and a tremendous and lingering bitterness. There was a slight sourness that I think put me off, I wasn't expecting that. Not my favourite but a decent beer. Mouthfeel - smooth and light bodied, however this was also a touch flat which detracted. Overall - perhaps purchasing a bottle might be a worthy choice, to see if tastes have changed and maybe the tap I received this beer from was faulty or the keg was old.

Dark gold/pale amber, it has a small white head soon thinning to a thing ring. Aroma is rich yeasty bread, wet tea leaves.

It evocatively tastes and feels fresh and mineraly, claiming drinkability and balance from the very beginning; Yet, it almost feels like this character can be easily overlooked if one is to - for one reason or another - dispense insufficient attention to it. This grants this beer immense versatility, as it does not challenge for constant pontification but rather leaves the burden of choice to the drinker, to make this brew as complex as he / she desires.

Crispy pretzel-like malts start, and fade to a punctuated hops profile. The hops bitterness last in the mouth along with a faint cracker taste throughout, leaving a satisfying aftertaste. The mouthfeel is slick and surprisingly bubbly for a cask beer. Although it goes down quickly, the robustness of the malt and hops is enough to make up for a watery consistency.

S: just like the old Young's Bitter, Goldings dominate the aroma, accompanied by light sulphur, salty-sweetness, some dustiness, and zesty citrusness... overall, very light and very clean. T: the first sip tells me that this is slightly different from the cask-conditioned Young's Bitter that I can remember, in that it's very bitter from the start with an extra dose of spiciness and clean zestiness, supporting the light maltiness just fine... long, dried-tea-leafy bitterness sits in harmony with the light malt flavour and aroma, while the texture is clean on top of the lingering chewy bitterness. M&amp;D: lightly-fizzy, but very well bottle-conditioned... It retains the freshness of a true cask of Young's Bitter, while the slightly higher level of bitterness contributes a bit more body, hence more drinkable to my liking!

Taste: Buttery and rich, with a solid, sweet-but-not-cloying malt base and just enough of an edge from the hops, which add a light, aromatic, piney sappiness. Dry, light, and vinous fruity notes appear as well, a bit of lychee and pear, possibly from the yeast. Mouthfeel: Smooth and clean, not particularly chewable but not too light either.

Lacing is unbelievable with big rings left behind down the entire glass. The aroma is mostly of Goldings and Fuggles, with a small bit of biscuity malt. The taste is very well balanced and dry, much hoppier than the other cask bitters I sampled. Hops reast on a delicious malt background.

Contrary to what some previous reviewers have said, I still think this beer is a very hoppy, citrusy offering. Perhaps the very ""malty"" pints are just bad pints were the lines are not properly cared for!? This is a lovely light amber colour with a nice white head. The aromas are of citirc hops and honey-like malts. The taste is similar to the aromas. They are very citrusy, hoppy, and honey-ish.

3.08,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,"Having had this once wonderful ale on each of my three trips to England ('91, '01, '03), I have noticed a shift in balance of this session bitter from the hop to the malt. My first experience of the ale was at the Lamb on Lamb's Conduit Street in the City. There was a glorious light citrus flavour (edging toward grapefruit) to Ordinary that made it eminently suppable. My second experience of Ordinary came in 2001 at the Brewery Tap in Wandsworth - a nightmare. The beer was heavily oxidized, thin and unrecognizeable as the ale I had so loved ten years earlier. It was only my experience of the ale a week later at a free house in Canterbury (The Phoenix) that restored my faith in Youngs. While its taste profile had shifted to a more malty one, its old citrus taste was still hanging on. During my most recent trip to England in February, I discovered that the taste profile of Ordinary had continued its shift to the malt. The predominant flavour of my most-recent pints has been a slight honeyed malt. It's still quite drinkable, but not what it once was.",2003-09-10,42187,Young's Bitter

Pours a dark (brownish) apricot. Smell: very very light fruity hop smell. Taste: ah, well, hmm. I suppose that English bitters can be just about anything, can't they? I was surprised to find this one quite fruity and yet very well rounded and not overpowering at all. The aftertaste remains true enough to the original flavor - very light malts with just a touch of citrus. Drinkability: ah, again. They can call it what they will - for ME this would be a perfect ale for the warmer days of summer if it were chilled just a wee bit more and with a wee bit more carbonation.

Can loose its head quickly due to the absence of sparklers in the South of England. Progressively becoming available in selected outlets in the Midlands and North of England, but sometimes served with a sparkler. The term Ordinary Bitter is correct, but unfortunately mis-placed when applied to Youngs Bitter. It is far from ""ordinary"", and this is one of the best Cask-Conditioned Bitters available in my opinion. Highly Quaffable, a true Gallon-Lunchtime Beer. A CAMRA Award winner on more than one occassion, that simply has to be tried on Cask, preferably in a Youngs House in London UK, to fully appreciate its nuances and intended drinking environs.

I made my second pilgrimage to the Young's brewery tasting pub just last week. The first thing I do is get on my knees and thank god I'm there. Then they ""pull"" me a pint of the nectar of the gods. If I had access to this here at home I WOULD develop a serious problem. The King!

The pour is golden yellow with a modest white head that diminishes to ring. Slow moving carbonation fluttering up to the top and crystal clarity. The aroma is subtle but emits sensations of toasted bread, light spice, and grassy hops. Light body. Toasted sweetness in the flavor with a notable earthy bitterness finishing things off.

Crisp with a smooth bitterness, the malt enhances the hops nicely which are earthy. A bit of sweetness in the finish. Finish lingers a bit into a drier feel. On the lighter side of medium bodied. Quite quaffable and a nice pre-dinner drink. Elements of the ESB style are present (e.g., fruity nose) although stylistically it might deviate a touch.

Not off to a good start but lets give it a go. Look: Clear honey-gold body with a fluffy white head. The head lingered well and left solid lacing down the glass. Smell: Biscuity, a touch of diacetyl butteryness, and a touch of mossy hops.  Taste: Watery grains, mild earthy hops, and vague minerals.  Feel: Loose, a bit slick, dry at the end.  Overall: This beer is an example of how Sam Adams constantly blurs the line between craft and macro beer. They consistently release these mixer 12 packs which are usually enticing due to their low price and numerous options in each pack. But they tend to be a touch monotonous and one dimensional. This is drinkable enough but I would never buy it on it's own. Oh yeah and it isn't an ESB.",2016-01-11,208360,Session Ale-Extra Special Bitter

Slight lacing. S: Aroma of rich caramel malt with hints of toasted grain, nuttiness, subtle fruitiness, ale yeast, leafy hops and mild grass/hay. Nicely balanced. T: Tastes of caramel malt with notes of mild roasted grain, a touch of barley sugar, nuttiness, ale yeast, faint fruitiness, leafy hops and grass/hay.

Mildly astringent. Aftertaste of bitter leafy hops, caramel malt, nuttiness and ale yeast. O: Pretty good - a traditional ale with a classic flavour profile.

Mouth feel was a wee bit slick but not bad at all. Over all not a bad pint at all. Served with the chill off of course. I would order this again.

3.71,4.0,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"500ml can - a sort of surprising entry to the Alberta market for the typically 'once-in-a-while' English import segment. This beer pours a clear, bright medium copper amber colour, with two fingers of puffy, rocky, and bubbly tan head, which leaves some disintegrating ice shelf lace around the glass as things lazily sink away. It smells of grainy and biscuity pale malt, muddled dark orchard fruity notes (prunes and raisins, predominately), a hint of wayward son yeastiness, and some sassy leafy, weedy, and grassy noble green hop bitters. The taste is bready and doughy caramel malt, some further indistinct black stone fruitiness, a touch of peppery spice, faded yeasty esters, and more testy earthy, floral, and dead grassy verdant hoppiness. The carbonation is fairly pervasive in its come-hither frothiness, the body a so-so middleweight, and sort of smooth, with a wee airy creaminess settling in as things start to warm up a bit out of the ol' basement frigo. It finishes off-dry, the base malt holding tight, amongst the lingering spicy and hoppy intransigence. Overall, this is a fairly enjoyable English bitter, the hops doing well to elicit some New World elan, in addition to their inherent old-school qualities. I'm a bit taken by this one, even as its ABV seems typically strangled, as such.

Plus with my penchant for English Bitters being quite strong I can only chalk this up to a sizeable slip under the old beerdar. Anyway it is here and pre-review warming up to room temp as we speak. Before I begin I must add that this is a bit on the heavy side for a Bitter at a lofty 4.8% ABV, and Wells &amp; Young’s track record for me has been hit-and-miss with their Courage Russian Imperial Stout being their high water mark IMO, so who knows where Directors will end up. Poured from a 500ml bottle into a nonic pint. A: Clear copper body with a light splotchy thin beige head on top - about as English Bitter as old English pies with a pint of English Bitter beside it and a side of English Bitter sauce to go with the pie. 8/10. S: Toffee malt, earthy/nutty notes, hints of dark fruit - raisin, plum, with a veneer of herbal hops in the background... overall this Bitter smells like a bit of excitement compared to the namby-pamby lightweight 4.4% Bitters out there, expecting some explosive not-your-average-day-in-the-pub-watching-football-which-is-called-soccer-elsewhere-in-the-world-to-differentiate-it-from-other-forms-of-ball-sports action here. 8/10. T: Wow, what a let-down... the flavour is a shadow of the above aromas... it’s not explosive action, just a muted Bitter at best. I’ve had plenty of Bitters that would blow this out of the water flavourwise - several of which weigh in at 4.4% ABV. This is a disappointingly light where-it-counts English Bitter... at least the flavours are as expected from the aroma (toffee/earthy/nutty/raisin/plum) with a slight sour/bitter finish, but otherwise this brew warrants my giant beige stamp of ‘MEH!’. 6/10. M: Mid to light bodied with some playful carbonation that does nothing to damper that classic English pub vibe. 8/10. D: Well Courage Directors Superior Ale really drops the ball when it counts in the flavour department and totally misses out on a near flawless try/goal [as long as we’re going along with the footy theme here]. Here is a list of better Bitters for you to try instead of this average drop: Ruddles County, Brakspear Bitter, St. Peter’s Ruby Red Ale and Adnams Bitter - tell me you still prefer Courage after trying these finer brews. 5/10.

Coming in a nicely curved brown bottle, BB 13/12/2013, served cool in straight imperial pint glass. A: dark reddish amber to light copper in colour, coming with a thin layer of off-white frothy head to last on top of constant flows of mild carbonation. S: applely and tea-leafy hoppiness laced with a light touch of citrusness, coupled with caramely and mildly buttery maltiness. A good swirl wakes up the soothing aroma of roast and nutty malts.

Mouth Feel: Medium carbonation Taste : Very sweet , caramel predominates very little hop flavor Overall: This is probably not the same beer as the cask version. Not a bad beer in the can it seems fresh and very drinkable but there is little complexity or hop character for a Bitter. It almost has the malt sweetness of a Brown Ale.

This continued through to the taste, a nice flavour of malts and caramel/toffee initially followed by a burst of fruitiness and hops in the aftertaste.

Taste: Initial flavor of American (Centennial or Cascade) blends to a more characteristic English hoppiness. Slight diacetyl yields some toffee hints to the malt character. Proper cellaring does this brew a world of good, bringing out some of the yeasty fruitiness as well.  Mouthfeel: Balance leans a bit more towards the bitter side, but still good.

I remember I was not much keen on it at first, having been on a diet of Ansells (ugh!!) and M&amp;B bitter (how my tastes have changed since!!) though I grew to enjoy it over a few weeks. Having had it again recently, was surprised it seemed to have changed little from how I remember it, and for (as Mark says in here) a beer by one of the big bad boys of UK brewing, its not a bad drink, acceptable when no other decent beer or guest available. Reasonable balance between malty sweetness and hoppy bitterness, making it easy to drink and would make a good session beer, not being too strong. Certainly one to try if you have not had it before.

3.89,3.5,3.75,4.0,3.75,4.0,"Poured from a 330ml bottle at the Trenchard Arms, Katong, Singapore. Pretty pricey at first glance - the bartender warned me about this just as I was ordering it; kinda makes me wonder why... A: Hazy, hazy, HAZY red. Ruby red this is not - more like a burnt umber. Or could that just be the cloudiness of this beer? I'm not too sure - but it sure as heck is not the bright red of a ruby. S: There's something here that brings me back - something savory, malty, smoked even. Is it funky? Perhaps - but I'm edging towards no. It's probably just the malt and yeast. Kinda' reminds me of Frangelico, the burnt, sweet smell. The dude next to me ordered a Mac and cheese - there goes any other real chance of breaking down these aromas. T: There's that savory sweet Frangelico-ness. Yep, it's somewhat smoky, lightly peppery, somewhat nutty. It's definitely sweet, like a roasted organic sugarcane marshmallow sweet. The burnt-sweetness lingers in the after taste for a LONG time. I'm reading the label now and everything is falling into place. This is brewed with RYE Crystal malt. I'm now experiencing that sheepish feeling when you completely misjudge something. M: This beer is dry. Not bone-dry, no. It's dry like laundry fresh out of the drier. It's friendly, comforting, accessible and totally something I'd not be scared of. On that same same note, it's not something with too much bite - it's light for the flavors it has. It's not slick, it doesn't linger on your lips, but hey, at least it goes down easy. Final thoughts: This is a pretty decent rye-based red ale. The flavors are there, the complexity too. I understand what the bartender was warning me about now - it's not something that someone with a background in cheap macro-lagers or lighter ales might appreciate, but it's also not something that someone who appreciates rauchbier could pick up and fall in love with.

A bit biscuity, and reminiscent of an amber ale, but nice nonetheless. Taste: drier than the aroma would suggest, but with plenty of caramel and biscuity character. Hops are earthy and forward, with a pleasingly balanced bitterness. I'm not a huge amber-biscuit guy, but in this application it works (it's the English talent for restraint, I think).

Some patchy streaks of lacing form as well. Overall, a pretty good-looking beer. Nose is quite hoppy, with a crisp herbal bite and almost the hint of American strength to it. The suggestion of citrus, along with a poignant rosemary bite. This is underscored by a solid, slightly caramelly malt sweetness, perhaps a bit richer than the hops should really allow. Overall, though it's a pleasant aroma. Taste is smooth but a bit timid. Light malt characters come through pleasantly, but there's no richness; hops give more of that herbal flavour, but there's no bite and little to no bitterness. Still, we get a light dance of dark citrus and a balanced low-calorie caramel to balance it somewhat. It's decent enough. Feel is smooth and light and pleasant enough. Overall, this is very decent stuff. Solidly, if unimaginatively made and providing a pleasant drinking experience.

4.04,3.5,4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,"Here's another on the 'to do' list of beer reviews: St. Peter's Ruby Red Ale. Spying the unique bottle at an expensive but well appointed craft beer shoppe [sic], I made a mental note to one day quench my mighty thirst with this fine beverage, when I found it a cheaper price (of course!). Said day is upon us thanks to Daniel S. Murphy Esq. the bottle-shoppe [sic] that is well known to slash prices and aggressively undercut, to our collective benefits, in the quest to destroy the opposition... ahh Dan Murphy's you magnificent bastards. Poured from a 500ml bottle into a nonic pint. A: It's in the name but I'll say it anyway; deep ruby red body with a nice sticky tan head. S: Fantastic aroma! A mixture of sloe berry, dark cherry, chicory, hint of vanilla with a heavy roast malt (almost rye-like) base. This is one brew that smells medieval in its earthiness (and I should know as I travelled back in time to the middle ages last week). T: That chicory flavour is upfront, with a smattering of ripened fresh coffee beans, sloe berries and that chewy malt base that carries through to a mildly bitter base. Slight sourness that carries throughout and lets one know that a decent yeast was used. M: Mid to light body, slightly chewy, with a light carbonation. D: Impressed with this one. Doubtless to say it's a bit on the expensive side for what you get (Hook-Norton's Old Hooky is a half-decent cheaper replacement), but it pleases nonetheless, and if you want to try a dirty/earthy flavoured ale then this is a good pick. Treat it as a half-way between an English Bitter and a Stout and you get the idea of what sort of flavours to expect. Food match: Roasted game meats like partridge, grouse, woodcock and venison. Also roasted wild pig on a spit would lend its medieval feel to the brew.",2012-11-06,29633,St. Peter's Ruby Red Ale

S: Robust toffee, biscuit, and chocolate malts bursting with dark fruit - black cherries, raisins, plums, and candied figs - and notes of molasses, butterscotch, and dark chocolate. Fruity and earthy, slightly woody hop aromas throughout. Hints of licorice and ethanol. Not unlike an oloroso, altogether. T: Toffee, biscuit, and chocolate malts with cocoa, molasses, black cherry, and plum undertones. Fruity notes from the malt and floral hops last into the woody, citric, resiny, almost lactic hop bitterness in the finish. A definite 'hard' minerality and mild yeastiness throughout. M: Medium-bodied with mild, smooth carbonation that pricks just a bit on the sip; slightly chewy, quite hearty for a bitter. The long-lasting finish is dominated by earthy, tangy bitterness that isn't refreshing but rather cleansing, perhaps beyond the point of balancing the flavour profile. Either way, the astringency keeps it drinkable despite the surprisingly robust body. D: I'd definitely agree with most critics that this ale is enduringly bitter even for a bitter, but I personally find that the complex flavour profile stands up to it.

3.62,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,"From my LCBO winter gift pack, along with the Golden Ale. Poured into the branded St. Peter's glass. To truly get the ""ruby red"" as described in the name, one really has to hold this beer aloft in the sunlight, where the colour truly shows. Out of the light, the brew takes on a murky chestnut hue, with only a few streaks of red when the light hits it. The name is a bit inapt, I have to say. Left behind a thin layer of off-white foam, which receded into a thin ring. Some flecks of lacing near the top of the glass. The nose is quite pleasant and full: malt, caramel, chocolate, earthy notes and cream. Not bad at all. A bitter, almost astringent mineral taste pervades the beer, which is fine I suppose, but tends to hurt the soft, but tasty malt and hop profile lurking underneath. Still, this isn't a bad-tasting ale at any stretch, its just a bit tart, and not because of the hop content.  Thick, a bit bready, mild carbonation. Not a bad beer, went down pretty well, but the tartness is becoming a bit over-powering. Tone that down a touch (perhaps on cask or fresher it would do better?) and this would be a great English bitter.

Not a traditional ruby colour, but I like the way it looks. There is a lot going on in the aroma and taste. The aroma is bright and hoppy, with sweet malt undertones, as well as hints of spice, dark fruit like dates and a Winter-Ale-like pine. The taste has a thickness and flavour almost like chocolate syrup, with the dark fruit and a taste of what I can best describe as damp wood coming through, along with a nicely-balanced bitterness. There is a slight trace of green tea in the aftertaste, like other beers from this brewery. I find the Ruby Red Ale feels thick on the tongue, almost bready.

3.67,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,"Ruby Red is misleading; Sunkist amber, or grapefruit juice, is more like it. It doesn't sparkle much like a ruby either, the beer has little shine; its colour is monotone and appears washed out. Its surface is almost without even a trim, the few veins of carbonation arrange in such a way as to appear like dried-out flesh at the center of a halved orange.  Grapefruit, orange... those come up in the aroma as well, albeit quite subtly. Styrian Goldings, as it were, impart a lightly herbaceous kind of leafiness, one with earthy, tea leaf-like overtones. The malts, for their part, seem a doughie pillow of biscuits, fresh out the oven. Taken in together, they make a more than adequate distraction for the nose.  My perceptions may be dangerously off the mark, but St. Peter's ales always seem to me to be overly abrupt, coarse, jarring and well, frankly, almost crude. It's something in the water, high mineral content, likely. There seems a dissonance between the beer's chewy, biscuity malts, its suggestively fruity hops and its brisk, rasping water profile.  It's too bad this discordance; the flavour is rather pleasant. Along with unsweetened iced tea, it showcases grapefruit juice - heavily watered down - with a spritz of chamomile, wild honey, watermelon and maybe a dash of Hungarian paprika. Sure, it leaves something to be desired but I don't feel too hard done by, especially being handed a full pint of it.  Living on this side of the Atlantic, St. Peter's will never be my favourite brewery. Granted, they make an impressive array of fairly decent, albeit pedestrian, offerings that would likely be real treats if available fresh, local and on cask. Ruby Red, however, like seemingly all this brewery's offerings, shows that conventional beer is rarely all that colourful.",2010-04-08,29633,St. Peter's Ruby Red Ale

Hops appear first in the mouth (Styrian Goldings according to the bottle), followed by mild roasted malt, then a solid back-of-the-mouth bitter hop finish.

S - Malt's coming through at first, toasted, biscuit, maybe some amber, hint's of fruit in the backround, hops giving a subtle spicy, herby aroma. T - Same as the aroma, the malt's I can taste are toasted, biscuit, amber, carared. The malts last for a second then the bitter comes through with a spicy, herb like taste, slight medicine taste's at the last stage of the bitter, but I might be talking myself into it due to the shape of the bottle. I like the water St Peter's uses, it seems to accentuate the hops in a way that seems different to a lot of other English Breweries. Mild fruit tastes come through, tart, berrylike flavours, very subtle. M - Smooth, a little oily, doesn't hang around for ever in the mouth. D - I could definitely have a few of these in a row, the finish of the hop bitterness might get a bit much after a while, but right now I wish i had about 2 more bottles to go with my dinner!

3.88,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,"BB 26/01/10, served cool in a straight imperial pint glass. NOTE: The beer is said to be brewed with Styrian Goldings spicy hops. A: the colour is more bright copper-ish than ruby red, very clear and just mildly carbonated in appearance, with a light beige creamy froth well-sustaining on the top. S: aromatic malty and fruity just like a ruby ale should be, hinting at ripe plums, red beans, caramely and even (faint) chocolatey malts, toasted apples, sweetened black tea, and a wee touch of sour yeastiness, while the Styrian Goldings' aroma lags behind as a ""sidekick"" only - balanced and nice overall. T: like on the nose, the flavour is richly fruity-malty upfront and backed by an aromatic whiff of dried tea-leafy &amp; semi-spicy hops, then leading towards a bready middle of amber malts, dried-grapefruity fruits plus a lightly sour yeastiness, before the lightly dry (roast-malt like) palate, residual nuttiness and soothingly bitter dried-leafy hops take over. Pleasantly dry and bitter in the end, but still showing an overall decent balance b/w malts and hops. M&amp;D: the carbonation is just light enough to render a refreshing texture, while the body remains medium for the moderate flavour profile. Overall, this dark amber malty ale gets rather good support from the hops, from time to time showing a necessary sour-fruity edge to balance off the sweetness and bitterness.

3.58,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,Picked this one up in the St. Peter's Holiday Pack. Also included was a bottle of the IPA and a tall St. Peter's pint glass. Upon initial pouring this beer had a minimal head that lasted for quite some time almost reminiscent of a cream ale. It poured a nice deep red colour that seemed to hint at a very nice beer. Initial smell was typical of a bitter. A bitter smell that finished sweetly. Very enticing. My initial impression upon tasting this was that it had an almost creamy taste to start that finished with a nice light burn from the bitter. I was left with a slight smokey/peat type taste that was quite nice. Mouth feel was very much in keeping with an english beer. Not a lot of fizz which IMO makes a beer feel somewhat heavier. Felt much heavier than the alcohol content would suggest. I found this very drinkable and think it's a shame that they don't sell this as a single at the shop that I go to because I would probably buy this often.,2008-11-06,29633,St. Peter's Ruby Red Ale

Somewhat opposite of the nose going on with the palate; you mostly get nice mellow wheaty flour-like flavors up first, which is briefly accentuated by the bright orange from the nose.

The nose is all mango, peach, and just a hint of citrus. Those big sweet notes hide a lot of the malts present, as well as the floral aspect. The aroma isn't strong, but it's unmistakenly sweet and tropical. The taste is quite bitter for a such a sweet smelling beer. First to arrive is bitter tropical fruit, sweet and sour peach, and hops. It progresses slightly to more malty tones, biscuit, cardboard, and then finishes with more bitter hops. There is a leafiness to this ale, and the smallest herbal undertone which gives it an earthiness as well as a fruitiness. It feels over carbonated to my tastes which removes some of the nice resiny fruity mouthfeel that it's hiding. Light bodied with a dry finish.

The taste is more sweet caramel/toffee malt, muddled orange and grapefruit fruitiness, and capable leafy, earthy hops. The bubbles are fairly sedate, but not out of things entirely, the body medium light in weight, and just smooth enough.

3.7,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,"With experimental ingredients at their disposal, De Molen captures the true essence of artisans with the brew kettle. With no clue as to how or why they name their beers the way they do, the painfully banal labels in no way represent the quality behind the shell. This schizophrenic pale ale is a perfect example.... Op &amp; Top pours with a hazy orange-honey color that allows a serene glow to permit from behind. The beer builds a creamy and densely knit head that retains very well after reducing to a sheet across the glass, but the off white foam laces with pockets of foam that clings to the glass. Very perfumy as the aromatic hops share a bouquet of flower pedals, citrus and tropical fruit, lavender, cilantro, coriander, and mint. The charismatic scent is backed by the mild honey-like malts that carry and inherent biscuit-starchy scent that gives a glimpse into the British malt complex. Very fruity to taste as the flavors of tangerine, pineapple, lemongrass, cilantro, coriander, and mild detergent start the bright flavors. Backed by a dry malt taste, the barley provides mild malt support but allows the sharp hops and peach and apricot esters to buffer the developing hop bitterness of grass and herbs. Even a slight and oddly placed peppery note of white pepper and medicine balance the malt and fruit and weave seamlessly into the hop make up.  Mild bodied throughout, the early creaminess quickly morphs into a dry-malt texture to allow the hops and yeast bite to govern past mid palate. Finishing minty, herbal, and with light hop derived astringency, the beer's dryness quite like American ales.

3.37,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,"Excessively carbonated, almost obscenely so, this beer forms a head in the bottle as soon as it's opened. Fortunately, it doesn't gush, but it seems that it's a close thing. Pours a bright golden-copper colour, slightly hazed from a bit of disturbed yeast sediment, with a huge head, fully four fingers deep, of crackling white bubbles that leave sudsy residue as they collapse their way down under their own aerated anarchy. Way, way too carbonated, but the colour looks good at least. Nose is extremely hoppy and fresh, giving resinous pine characters mixed with green coconut, pineapple, mild citrus and a medicinal hint of ozone. The released CO₂ confuses this all and makes it more effervescent and anarchic, but the base aroma is so good it doesn't matter. Lovely blend of hops. Taste is very mild by comparison, giving only a slight organic bite on the end to signify any hops. Otherwise, rather thin and light, with just a slight wheaty grain character, thin but round. No bitterness. I guess all hops were extremely late additions, it's all aroma, with very little flavour and no alpha release. Feel is thwarted by the bloating carbonation after a while, and even then, it's a thin basis on which to build a beer. I've had much better from De Molen. While this has good things going for it, it ends up a relatively insipid beer overall. Drinkable in its way, and it has its place in the extensive De Molen range, but it has a hard job to stand up on its own.",2011-05-19,61977,Op & Top

The nose is very pleasant with aromas of juniper and pine, hops, and citrus. A wonderfully complex beer on the tongue, this is super malty - a surprising feature in an IPA. Lots of citrus hops, but the strong juniper in the nose is only in the background in the mouth. Not a very bitter IPA, it has a rich coffee-grounds/malt finish. Overall a very nice and unique IPA.

Appearance: a pure golden-copper in colour with carbonation clinging to the glass rather than rising to the top. A thin off-white head (even with a vigorous pour) lasts the distance throughout the session. Looks pretty good for an English mid. Aroma: a pretty typical sweet English malt profile - toffee and butterscotch. Definitely stronger on the nose than I would have expected for 3.6% ABV. Taste: whilst it even tastes smooth (however that works!), the flavour is far more demure here than on the nose. Still the toffee with some buttery flavour and some toasted malts. Not as good as the nose due to the feel, but still quite nice for such a low ABV beer. Aftertaste: the flavours drop away slowly without much in the way of bitterness. Still that lingering sweetness from the malts - not cloying, still quite pleasant but also light. Mouth feel: medium in feel with a lower to moderate carbonation. Very, very English, and I still don't quite get it. Makes the beer feel a bit flat in flavour, though maybe that is due to differences in climate between England and Queensland Australia. It is very smooth though. Overall: normally I am not that big a fan of English mid bitters due to the massive price in Australia (mainly due to our stupid excise laws and taxes on, well, everything). This is a good-tasting beer for a 3.6% - it is fairly light, but the flavours are there and are quite identifiable.

Tetley's is one of those modest English chaps, more interested breaking the Enigma code at Bletchley Park than piloting a Spitfire off the coast of Dover and shooting Jerries down. Let's face it every bally one of them played their part in winning the Battle of Britain - just as the IPA is boisterous and boastful so too does this smooth English Bitter have its place in the Battle for my Taste-buds [end analogy here]. Poured from a 440ml nitro-can into a nonic pint. A: Presents with a clear copper body and a tight 1.5cm creamy cream-coloured head, as with all the classic nitro-can ales (Guinness, Murphy's, Cafferey's, Kilkenny, Boddingtons, etc...) the presentation is perfect - it's hard to go wrong with a nitro-can. S: Sweet caramel malts give way to some light fruity hops and metal from the can, it is mild-mannered and laid-back here, like those cyber-breaking Bletchley boys. T: Again sweet caramel malts with light fruity hops and that metallic hint, if this brew was a bit more flavoursome it might have covered up the metal note, but it's not so deal with it taste-buds. Also noted is a dry finish, odd for an English Bitter to take on more of a dry-than-bitter aspect but my belief is that this beer is styled in the Irish-Cream-Ale vein. M: Mid to light bodied, a little watery with an English pub tack flat carbonation. D: This and Boddington's are both basically the same beer with different marketing/labels, does that mean it's crap? By all means no... it is however light, predictable and a tad boring... there are bigger and better beers vying for my attention, even in the ""session ale"" category, QED: Ruddles County.

Pours a clear copper-amber colour, topped with the usual nifty cascading, creamy white head typical of nitro beers. It's about one finger thick at first, with good retention as it takes quite a while to thin out. A beautiful-looking beer, really - too bad I can't say anything nearly as positive about the aroma. Leafy notes come through, with some sponge toffee sweetness and not much else besides mineral water. I guess aromas don't get much cleaner than this, but for the most part it's just empty. While I'm at it, the flavour is similarly weak and uninspired - although I'll append to that statement, that it tastes at the very least, agreeable. Sponge toffee and red apples make up the bulk of the flavour, with some honey sweetness and a vaguely leafy, bittersweet finish that has a touch of metallicity. Light-bodied, with a flat, watery mouthfeel - while I do appreciate the silky smooth feel on the palate, when combined with the weak flavour it just gives me the impression of a lazy, forgettable English ale. Final Grade: 3.23, a C+. Tetley's Smoothflow isn't the worst nitro beer I've ever had, but it's definitely not the best, either. This is a mediocre English bitter/pale ale, with no real strong points to counter the typical weak points of this style of beer (weak aroma, mild flavour and flat mouthfeel). At $2.50 a can (and only available in four packs), this isn't something I anticipate I'll be returning to at any point in the near future - it reminds me a little of Boddington's, in that both are proof-positive that imported ales can be every bit as dull and lifeless as macro lagers.",2014-01-05,20558,Tetley's Smoothflow

It does, however, have a nice, earthy hop bite.  Drinkability: It is canned British ale. Tasty and decent, but nothing special. Enough said.",2013-02-01,20558,Tetley's Smoothflow
2.15,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.5,2.0,"Being a smooth operator, I figured this beer would be right up my alley. Golly, was I ever wrong! It tastes like nitrogen and water. There is no expiry date, but I'm not familiar with any beer or beer-like ingredients that completely vanish after a beer expires. As it warms up, the tiniest bit of hop bitterness is present near the end, along with the big old woosh of nitrogen. This is one of the least flavorful beers I've ever had, right up there with Coors light. This review is therefore sparse, as I just don't have all much to say. It's not awful, certainly, as being awful would require some flavor of some sort. It's just hardly even there.",2013-01-03,20558,Tetley's Smoothflow
2.66,4.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,"3.60% ABV confirmed. Can acquired in Ibiza, Spain and served into a Guinness pint glass. Reviewed from notes taken April 2011.  A: Pours a two finger head of lovely cream lacing with a nice bubble show, though not as good as the one seen when I reviewed this beer on draught. Head is of decent thickness and retention. Colour is a gold-copper.  Sm: Very light scent of cream and barley. T: Creamy open. Cream and butterscotch body with lingering effects as the barley drives the finish. Balanced well for what it is but relatively simple. The finish is quite lovely, actually. Built somewhat atypically, but nicely. No alcohol or yeast comes through. I actually prefer this to the draught version.  Mf: Creamy, extremely smooth, and wet. It ought to be more dry to coax out the flavours, but that's the least of its problems.  Dr: It's marketed in Ibiza as an Irish beer, but this only serves to piss off those of us who live in Ireland. Serve cold; elsewise it suffers. It's expensive by Spanish standards, but it's alright. Very low ABV for the price and quality.  C-",2012-11-07,20558,Tetley's Smoothflow

It poured with a finger high creamy and dense off white head that has excellent retention properties and consistently left a short head covering the surface and a thick coating of bubbles running down the sides of the glass. S: Very slight aromas of toasted malts are present in the nose. T: The taste is similar to the smell but is a bit stronger and also has some notes of tea leaves and slight hints of bitterness. M: It feels light-bodied and a little smooth and thin on the palate with a low to moderate amount of carbonation. O: This beer is quite sessionable; I would have no problem drinking this beer all night long. The smell and taste could be a little stronger, but the mouthfeel from the nitro-can helps to keep things a little interesting.",2012-10-27,20558,Tetley's Smoothflow
3.01,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,"Tetley's Smooth Flow pours with both sound effects and spectacle. The nitro-can sounds a loud, cracking siren and then gears up for what appears a magic trick: thousands of tiny bubbles synchronized into dance, looping and dipping, swarming up the glass like a flock of starlings under attack. In biology this phenomena is known as 'allelomimesis'; in layperson terms it's called 'cool'. And it results in a bed of head that could literally serve as a bed!  The brilliantly copper beer looks maltier than it smells. It's slim-pickings for the olfactory bulb. Maybe it's that thick sponge atop that's preventing any aromas from leaking out, or maybe the people brewing this just don't want to shell out for decent ingredients, but whatever the case this aroma is lackluster, to put it politely. Aside from the water minerals and a hint of honeycomb toffee, it ain't got much going on. Tastes of biscuits and toffee are frustratingly vague. It seems oxidized. There is a teaspoon of the most pasteurized, mass-produced honey on the market, but it fails to result in any kind of redeeming sweetness. The minerals are easily the most noted component; it tastes (somewhat distastefully) as if the last thing to pass over the tongue is a handful of old pennies.  If you need rain, plan a parade and then invite liquid nitrogen. In my experience, the silly little 'widget' is responsible for ruining everything from aroma to flavour to texture. This particular offering suffers foremost from a deterioration of texture; the mouthfeel is dry and stale like cardboard and leaves a soapy remnant. Both bitterness and sweetness alike are nullified.  Tetley's was once the embodiment of real ale. Now, it is nothing more than a damaging testimony to the state of beer in England. The fact that an ale so insipid and uninspired can be a top-ten selling brand does not speak highly of British palates. However, I will concede that, insofar as mass-produced beers go, one could do much worse. That is in no way an endorsement, but it is about the most positive thing I can say.",2012-10-21,20558,Tetley's Smoothflow
3.96,4.5,3.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,"You've probably heard the one about the guy who walks into a bar. No? He says, ""Ouch!"" Bro. Woody went to Ardmore last Saturday to see what he could see and walked into a bottle shop. He said, ""Yay! Look at all of these new CANs in furtherance of The CANQuest (TM)!"" It is called The Beer Shoppe in Ardmore Plaza and for those that do not live in PA, you have no idea what a rare bird it is to find a quality bottle shop, especially one that provided me with no less than five (5) new CANned beers on my first visit. This is one of those beers. From the CAN: ""Light English Ale""; ""A uniquely smooth taste: For best results; Serve cold from the fridge, pull the tab, listen to the surge &amp; pour down the side of the glass in one smooth movement.""  The Crack immediately caused The Surge, a massive off-gassing of what I assume to be N2. It is always good to read directions and I followed theirs to the letter. I employed a gentle Glug, running the beer down the side of the tilted glass, where it began a beautiful cascade upon arrival at the bottom. I was left with a dense, thick finger of tawny head head with excellent retention. Color was a deep coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a pleasant biscuit malt quality. Mouthfeel was full and creamy thanks to the N2 presence. It was light in its flavor, a biscuit/cracker-like semi-sweetness, but still quite pleasant. Finish was likewise semi-sweet with the maltiness lingering well after the swallow. The low ABV makes it a sessionable CANdidate by even Ding's standards, but I am afraid that as a hophead, I would need more bitterness to sustain me.",2012-10-20,20558,Tetley's Smoothflow

Significant amounts of lacing are observed. S: Overall this beer has a mild aroma with light notes of caramel and slight sweet malts along with minimal amounts of hops. T: Like the smell of this beer, the taste is also quite mild but still enjoyable. There are light flavors of caramel malts with a light amount of sweetness upfront followed by a light amount of non-lingering bitterness (which is very mild and not aggressive). M: Light bodied with light to moderate amounts of carbonation (nitro-nation?). Smooth and creamy. O: Extremely easy to drink and very sessionable - you could literally drink this beer all day long with the low ABV and light body.

A hint of fruity ale yeast and faint stewed hops, along with cardboard and a slight staleness. Slightly sweet, with virtually no bitterness upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth and full-bodied, but has an artificial quality that detracts from it. Slight aftertaste of fruity malt. Not very good - doesn't live up to it's description as an English bitter.

This is a great-looking beer and I've never had a nitro misfire or a dud. Pours a deep, clear, gem-like amber colour. After settling, it has the creamiest, thickest white head I've seen come out of a nitro can. Settles as a sturdy film and collar without leaving any real lace. The smell is very mild, but builds character as it warms. Toasted malts are accented by a caramel-like sweetness and a slight metallic note.  Surprisingly rich in taste, it delivers bready, toasted malts and a very crisp and dry finish. I also get a mild orange pekoe tea note. The mouthfeel is unsurprisingly watery, but remains creamy feeling throughout the glass. There is a slight yeasty note on the back of the tongue.

T: Caramel with some sourness (in a good way), some yeasty flavours, with a mildly acidic and bitter aftertaste.

With a tremendous crack of the can, this beer pours a clear, medium auburn colour, with a teeming tower of puffy, foamy, and, well, mostly just plain-ass creamy ecru head, which leaves a solid splatter of obfuscating snowbank lace around the glass as it lazily recedes, all in the expected sense of cascading nitro pours everywhere - booyah! It smells of lightly doughy bready pale and caramel malt, a touch of over-steeped black tea, mild orchard fruit notes, and rather soft floral noble hops. The taste is softly biscuity, grainy, and bready pale malt, with some generic, and understated drupe fruitiness, and more understated earthy, floral hops.  The carbonation is quite low, and specifically innocuous, the body generally lightweight, certainly creamy, and very, very smooth. It finishes just off-dry, the languishing pale malt sort of hard to sympathize with, what with there being little in the way of challengers to the throne here, other than a bit of pithy chalkiness. A nice, pleasant enough, and refreshing mild bitter - like those low-fat snacks that still taste good (huh?) - you just want to, and will, consume more of it. My only prior experience with this offering was an unexpected foray into the lunchtime wait line at a fish 'n chips shop in a working class area of my city.

Smooth and extremely creamy.  D - Very smooth and creamy without being heavy helps the drinkability. The flavor isn't great but not really offensive.

3.68,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,473 ml can purchased as part of wellington's 4 pack from the LCBO. Served cold into a pint glass. Appearance - rich copper color that is crystal clear Nd topped by a finger of white head. The wispy froth on top doesn't stick around too much before it turns into a very thin layer of foam. A tiny bit of sticky lacing is present. Smell - nice earthy base with some significant malt presence and a nice whiff of dark fruits just hiding in the background. Taste - very mildly bitter with some dark fruit and grassy flavours mixed in. Full flavor despite the lower ABV. Mouthfeel - smooth and full yet fairly light bodied and a medium to high level of carbonation. Overall - a fine English bitter than isn't jaw dropping but is a very solid selection especially with a limited number of other local options.,2013-08-05,7300,Arkell Best Bitter
3.52,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,Appearance: A light orange/amber hue with good clarity and a thin cap of off-white foam. Aroma: Sweet caramel and amber malts with a certain 'grainyness' about it. Taste: Pleasant and light amber and caramel flavors at first and then lends a nice earthy bitterness in the second half and finish. At 4% ABV it has more flavor than I was expecting. A light metallic off-flavor in the aftertaste but otherwise pretty clean. Mouthfeel: Between thin and medium in body with slightly above average carbonation and good drinkability. Sessionable if you enjoy the style. Final Thoughts: A decent beer and a good example of how much flavor can be packed into a low ABV. Would I drink it again? Yes.,2013-04-28,7300,Arkell Best Bitter

Caramel is very low, hops are low. Bitterness is low, malt flavours are low, sweet finish. M: Carbonation is low but the body is low-medium. O: This beer starts well on the nose.

Taste: Like the aromas, it has some nice bready and toasty malts, light caramel, biscuits, earthy hops and slight citrus.

2.8,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,"3rd Review on BA 473mL can to bolleke globlet Purchased at a downtown Toronto LCBO for $2.60 App-A medium amber color to a pale amber color, no cloudiness, and a nice light carbonation. Smell- Nothing too exciting here, the label on the can says it best, it's a subtle, well-balanced, sessionable beer and the nose definitely alludes to that. Nothing overwhelms you but the caramel of the malt definitely comes to the forefront of the first whiff. Taste- very, very, very drinkable. The taste here is very light, subtle, and nothing is off-putting about it. But, at the same time--nothing is exciting about it either. There is a simple yet distinguishable malty character to the beer but despite what the label says I can't really make out the hoppy after-taste. Maybe it's because I enjoy my super-hoppy IPA's but nonetheless I just don't see it.  Mouth-I'd call this mouth taste light, at least as far as the category for bitters goes. The carbonation, like everything else with this beer, is subtle. Overall, in the mouth, the subtlety makes you want to swallow. Drink- If this was my local microbrew I'd buy it constantly to keep them in business. The beer has an ease of drinkability that makes it so simple to finish a six-pack. Plus, on this trip to the LCBO, out of all the local craft brews I purchased it was buy far the cheapest (even per mL, I nerdily felt the need to work it out.) Despite all of these facts, I live in Toronto and have so many small microbrews on tap from all over Ontario and the Greater Toronto Area that I probably won't pick up Wellington's Arkell Best Bitter again, but I'd tell a friend to pick it up when exploring the craft scene here in Ontario.

Nose has some nice hop notes, earthy, bready and lightly caramelized malts. A touch of diacetyl - simple and pleasant. Taste is a bit restrained, more lightly bready notes, some cracker, fruits but the richer earthier English malt notes on the nose weren't as pronounced on the palate.

Hops evident in the smell, somewhat yeasty as well.

3.63,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,"This polished, golden-amber tone looks like it belongs on a trophy. First prize! The way it gleams in the light you'd think they'd melted down brass. It is clear, despite some chill haze, and the bubbles are quite active. Its head was initially very puffy but in time the surface came to look like someone laid a tissue overtop, nothing more. Full, mellow tones of high-quality pale malt resonate in the nose along with some fruity ale yeast esters. A faint hop bitterness lingers but remains largely out of sight (err, smell). While it has nice character it doesn't have a ton of it. A trickle of honey-sweet malt comes through with warmth, however, and boosts things up a little bit.  The flavour, too, is driven by a full, but mellow, high-quality pale malt. Again, just a smidgen of toffee is noted. While some vague earthy bitterness registers, nothing more than a hint of hops is ever tasted. A touch of dry apple flavour provides the only highlight for a beer that is a cleanly brewed and, by and large, neutral.  Water salts bring about some of the characteristic mineral stiffness of English bitters, just enough to avoid the body being 'papery'. Still, it is a little light for my tastes (the fact that it's 4% alcohol notwithstanding). Hops delicately temper sweetness, although they are never noticed. Then again, this biscuity pale malt is hardly what you'd call 'heavy'.  Arkell Best Bitter is perfect for a 21st century beer set in early 20th century England. It is a simple, neutral, malt-forward and clean-brewed ale that lends itself to being knocked back easily, and in large quantities. This is a beer better suited to cask, no doubt, but even in the bottle is worth a try. A good alternative to commercial lagers.",2011-10-07,7300,Arkell Best Bitter
3.72,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,4.0,"Friends from Guelph have told me this stuff is pretty good, but this is the first time I've seen it at my LCBO. This can is courtesy of the brewery's pub pack, one of two brews in the pack I've never had before. Haven't had a bitter in months but I tend to like the style. Pours a brilliant translucent amber, topped with 1.5 fingers of creamy, beige head. Head retention isn't very impressive, but a filmy coat and reasonably thick collar remain behind. The smell is enough to get me interested; some caramel malts, plums, fresh baker's bread, and some earthy hops in the background. The smell wasn't misleading, I already like this stuff. Bready, lightly roasted malts, gentle caramel sweetness. Some fruity esters, as well as some buttery notes. These flavours all lie on top of a firm backbone of leafy english-style hops. Decent balance between the malts and hops but a bit more of the latter might help. Medium-thin body with moderate carbonation. It seems watery, but honestly for 4.0% ABV the flavour is reasonably rich. Very drinkable, but I've never had a bitter that wasn't.  Wellington's Best Bitter is well-crafted and tasty, certainly one of the better beers I've had from this brewery. For a lower ABV beer, there are plenty of flavours here, and none of them are off (although they are also by no means mind-blowingly awesome). If bitters are your thing, give it a shot. A perfect session ale, and one I will probably pick up again. [Updated Jan. 8 2014] Another can, this time compared with a few other bitters (Trafalgar ESB, Fuller's ESB and Wells Bombardier). This one is noticeably lighter than any of those three, but that isn't surprising given the abv. Arkell Best Bitter doesn't impress me as much as it used to, but it's still a passable session bitter that I don't mind returning to once in a while. I still say the English imports are better - not to mention cheaper.  Final Grade: 3.72, a B.",2011-08-26,7300,Arkell Best Bitter

S: Toffee malts and fresh floral, fruity, and slightly grassy hops. Undertones of biscuit malt, honey, peppery spices, and butter. T: Toasty biscuit malts forward with hints of caramel and light rye (much more dominant than in the nose). Faint floral hops come to the fore in the swallow and reveal a grassy, herbal bitterness, joined by roasted malts. Nutty undertones throughout. M: Body is on the heavy end of light with light but crisp, almost coarse, carbonation. The herbal hop and roasted malt finish provides light, lingering, and nuanced bitterness to balance the malty flavour cleanly and encourage a follow-up sip. D: An exceptionally flavoural and sessionable bitter; probably the best offering from Wellington's. It took me a while to find it (finally got it on tap at Hometown Eatery, i.e. Yukiko's, in Waterloo), but it is unquestionably worth seeking out.",2011-06-26,7300,Arkell Best Bitter

Creates a nice, crisp, inviting aroma that seems well-balanced. I get a fairly deep malt tone out front with hints of a dark fruit such as prunes and a nice, citrus and grass end. Unfortunately, after all that rich aroma, the taste comes off as slightly flat. There really isn't much going on hear. I get a bready, malty taste primarily and though I wouldn't put it high on any bitterness scale, there is enough to balance things nicely. The mouthfeel is a bit watery, but more substantial than most light beers. It has a decent feeling of carbonation on the tongue and leaves a clean dry aftertaste. I find this extremely drinkable. This review was based on my second sample out of a six pack, but I've already had enough to know the beer will make it into high rotation for social gatherings or poker games.",2011-01-13,7300,Arkell Best Bitter
3.53,4.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,"Copper-amber, with a decent foamy head, solid retention. Patches of lacing scatter the glass. Looks pretty damned good for a bitter. Nose is malt, dark fruit, mild earthy hops. Not a bad tasting bitter, but certainly not my favorite. Everything tastes washed out - not nearly the flavor profile I was expecting for something styled as a bitter. An English pale, perhaps, but not a bitter. Mild malt character, a touch metallic, earthy hops finish things off.  Despite this, I must say this one is a good session drinker - it's easy to get down, doesn't taste bad or anything, it's just nothing special. Mouthfeel is watery, feels a bit thin. Okay carb for a bitter. Decent, easy to drink, but lacks a solid flavor profile to really enjoy. I actually prefer the SPA to Arkell as my Welly sessionable.",2010-09-24,7300,Arkell Best Bitter

Again, I can't detect much hop flavor, but what I'm getting is light toasted caramel malt, biscuit, bread, and a somewhat minerally/spicy type finish.

This beer pours a slightly hazy medium orange colour, with two fingers of creamy white head, which leaves a ring of lace as it recedes. The aroma is caramel malt, and bitter, spicy hops. The taste is bready, light caramel malt, and earthy, floral hops. The carbonation is moderate, the body medium weight and smooth, and it finishes off-dry, the malt showing up the bittering hops a bit.

3.21,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,"Damn Wellington, what the hell happened here? This beer is devoutly average, with very few discernible traits. I expected a lot more from an otherwise excellent brewery.  Pours a copper hue with a decent sized head and stringy threads of lacing. Smell is grains, brown sugar, hops, and metallic notes (yeast?), but all of these aromas are incredibly subdued. Taste is caramel malt, a bit of nut and bread, earthy English-style hops (somewhat grassy), and lifeless grains in the finish. Some malty tartness rears its ugly head. But the biggest flavour that I'm picking up is water. Dido for the mouthfeel, which has minimal carbonation and only a trace of the spicy bite that you expect from a bitter. More water to end. I must ask, what is this beer trying to achieve? Most of the great bitters have way more fruit and hop flavours, with some nice British nuances like butter and toffee. Not so with Wellington Arkell. I think the brewer needs to take this one back to the drawing board and create something with much more character.",2009-11-11,7300,Arkell Best Bitter

Caramel malts with some hops behind. I very well balanced english bitter I would say. I get some earthy notes (from Northern Brewer hops maybe. I'm learning the different hops styles... don't quote me on that hops choice!!) T: The bitterness is light. I wish it would be bigger. Earthy notes in the taste too. I don't get caramel as I find in the aroma. M: Thin bodied. Refreshing. D: A good beer for hot summer day. I'm a little bit disappointed due to the lack of bitterness...

Big buttery malt, caramel and some fruity esters. The malt profile reminded me a lot of Amsterdam Blonde. Buttery malts, biscuit, caramel, grassy hops and a touch of spice. Nothing overly special but nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is thin, and watery, but considering the low ABV, I probably shouldn't expect much more. Easily quaffable, just not a really big fan of the taste. Overall, this brew seems like an average offering from a great brewery.

4.32,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,5.0,"Got this one from the local beer store, wanted to give it a shot as Wellington brews some exceptional beers and to try out a recipe I found for beer pancakes. Appearance: Poured with a nice, lighter copper color with a finger of head that did not retain that much but provided a slight bit of lace, which is good for a lighter beer.The carbonation on this beer looks perfect and it has nice clarity. Good stuff. Smell: A definite fruity nose with a nice malt backing. I'm catching a raisin and also plum scent to it with some sweeter toasted malt and a hint of toffee and tea. The thing I like about it is it is pronounced, unlike other lighter beers. My only complaint that while nice, it could use a bit more impact. Taste: A little bit tame, but certainly interesting and nice. Starts with a very nice sweet toffee malt flavor that shifts to a more biscuit like take with a touch of nut, berry and raisin and ends with a touch of somewhat peppery hops that cleanses the pallet. Mouthfeel: A bit hard to say, the carbonation doesn't play much of a role in this one and the head disappeared a bit too fast, but it's very smooth and doesn't linger which really helps it go down nicely. It leaves a slight dry biscuit aftertaste that is fairly nice, but doesn't need to be quite that dry. Drinkability: This stuff goes down like candy, incredibly smooth, very refreshing, no carbonation or stomach issues. Has a solid taste that makes you want to keep drinking it and is just an all around enjoyable drink. Final Thoughts: As my first regular English Bitter, I was impressed. I mean, with stuff like this around, it astounds me how the light lager is so popular. An all around great beer for all seasons. It would go well with dinner or be good for a hot day. It would be fine at the pub or to give to your buds at poker night. It would make a great session ale and is even good for cooking with.

So I was pretty surprised when this wasn't bitter at all... AT ALL.  I get a berry-like aroma (raspberry) off the malt, I think this might be fairly characteristic of Wellington's yeast as I get it from County Ale as well. A little bit of berry in the taste but overall I get alot of grass and a truck load of hay. The wrong sip and it tasted like a barn in my mouth from the hops, but no real bitterness to be seen other than in the subtle finish.  Perfect carbonation for the style... next to none. Mouthfeel was quite thin I found. This contributes to an insane drinkability for a best bitter. I could hammer these back and at 4%, that's a dangerous beer.",2007-10-12,7300,Arkell Best Bitter

I drink this Beer occasionally at the Merchant Ale House (St. Catharines, ON. CA.). The aroma is a bit bready. The colour is a dark golden/copper/amber. It has a tight head, and leaves some lace behind. Head retention is moderate. I get flavours of caramel, nuts, bread, and a little bit of butterscotch. Almost reminds me of a chelsea bun except without the cinamon.  The mouthfeel is silky soft, and not very viscous. Overall impression is that this is a good, mild Beer.

3.97,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.5,"Wellington's Arkell Best Bitter (named for the brewery's water source) is the last of the major Wellington brews that I've sampled. It is the one that I was least interested in, but their other spectacular offerings peaked my curiosity enough to try a six-pack. And while it's not the best of the Welly offerings, it's a respectable and tasty ale that's worth a try. Wellington Arkell Best Bitter pours from the industry standard bottle into my pint glass a moderate copper tone, with some lively carbonation and a two-finger head that dissapates within a few moments to a series of rings with some decent lacing. A good looking beer, though it doesn't appear quite as nice as some of Welly's darker entries. Smell is predominantly hops, mostly a citrus (lemon, orange?) hoppiness with a certain fruitiness. Some bready-biscuit notes, toasted grain and a touch of caramel and dark chocolate. A certain grassiness. Quite well-balanced and fairly inviting. Not as spectacular as their Strong Ale or Stout, but a respectable bitter. Taste is surprisingly well balanced, and showcases a respectable hoppiness. Initially caramel and toasted malt, bready biscuit notes, but offset by the hops. Grassy hops first, followed by the citrus hops that present so much in the nose. Faint dark chocolate throughout; initially a touch sweet, but finishes bitter and dry. A hint of fruitiness that extends beyond the simple citrus hops. This is not my favourite style, but this a respectable brew, especially if you're a bigger hophead than I am. Quite tasty, though. Mouthfeel is slightly off. Carbonation is a bit too spritzy, but not even nearly to the point of awful macro carbonation; body isn't too watery, but is faintly oily. At 4% ABV, however, most would be willing to forgive these shortcomings, as this is a highly sessionable English bitter. I don't know how many I would drink in a sitting, but I know most BAs might not be able to get enough of the stuff. It's misleadingly referred to as a light beer, by some, but this is terribly misleading. Welly's Best Bitter - while not the best entry in the brewery's flagship product line - is a very taste brew that's highly sessionable. It's an ale that grows on you; rich in taste and low enough in ABV that you can have a few without feeling guilty. Once again, Wellington demonstrates its position at the fore of craft brewing in Ontario.",2006-07-21,7300,Arkell Best Bitter

Starts with a nice wallop of malts then light and tangy fruityness to the tongue then builds to a pleasingly balanced hop and malt creamy mouth feel... finishes with a twang of citrus bitter with a lovely malty-bready after taste....

M - Light bodied, but with a slickness. Low carbonation despite the fizzy opening. D - Very nice session-type brew. At 4% it won't knock you on your ass after a few pints either.

4.47,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer, which I had on cask at Cest What in Toronto, reminds me why I like cask beers so much. This superbly balanced bitter pours a hazy copper with a patchy typical cask ale head and lots of thick lace swathes. The aroma is of grassy, herbal, earthy hops, top notch biscuity malts and a fruity yeastyness. This is hoppier than I expected, and definitely more so than the bottled version. Theres fresh cut grass, resiny, herbal and cedary hop notes. The malt flavor is thick and multifaceted - a very strong counterbalance to the hop profile. A nice creamy mouthfeel makes this a highly quaffable session beer. This is a near flawless bitter with astonishing depths of complexity, a must try Just a note, the freshness of casks at Cest What can be inconsistent, so some samples arent as good as others.

4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"On cask at the Arrow &amp; Loon in Ottawa, ON. Clear light copper with a small off-white head that does not provide the glass with much lacing, but this is expected for cask. The aromas are quite hoppy with a nice citrusy aroma in there as well. The malts are also in full effect with an excellent french bread like aroma in there as well. The cask version of this brew is much hoppier than the tap version with some lovely citrus flavors (orange, comes to mind). The taste is quite similar to the aromas with an excellent citrus hop taste up front and a more subdued, yet lovely french bread-like maltiness in the middle. The finish of this ale on cask is much more crisp, and dry, making for a much more refreshing tipple. Wow, another winner from Wellington, a damn good ordinary bitter in the cask conditioned format. Sure, this beer is still damn good on tap, but it really shines on cask! Another world-class UK style beer is being brewed in Ontario!",2004-09-21,7300,Arkell Best Bitter

3.98,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,"Pretty good, mild bitter. Appearance is kind of a dull sunset colour. Browns twingling with oranges. A 1 1/2 finger head that slowly settles to one finger at the finish. Small strings of lace coat the glass. Smells of caramel, barley, hops, apples(russet?) and ripe raspberries. Tastes a bit more bitter than the smell leads to believe. The malts are first, with the hops a close contender. Their is also a bit of toffee taste. Pleasantly balancing. The apples leave a somewhat sour aftertaste. Definite Granny Smith, but I still think their are some Russets in the mix. Mouthfeel is a little chewy and light. I would like to know what it'd be like with more body. One of those circumstances where more body could be an improvement, or fatal. Very drinkable. The light body makes for a good session beer, while the complex balances of taste and aromas leaves you curious for more. A good, nay, a terrific beer from Wellington.

Thing that stuck out was how damn bitter it buzzed... strong, tea-like tannins, as if the tea bag was left in the water way too long, squeezed out dry... toasty pale malt treads lightly at the bottom, but can hardly be seen below the harsh hoppy fog

At Local 44, it was Kick the Christmas Beers, here at Memphis Taproom, it was Caskafternoon and they had been alerted, I mean, warned, no, advised of my pending arrival.

Nose had a light sweetness underlain with a mild bitterness. Mouthfeel was silky smooth with a mild bitterness on the tongue. Finish was mildly bitter with a slight caramel taste underneath. My notes have me identifying it as either and English Bitter or an American Amber. I guess that I was not too far gone, eh?",2011-06-12,53373,Chester County Bitter
3.53,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,"A: The beer is clear copper in color and has no signs of visible carbonation. It poured with a finger high off white head that gradually faded away, leaving only a ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass. S: There are light aromas of fruits and bready malts in the nose. T: The taste is very similar to the smell but the flavors are stronger with some additional notes of caramel. No bitterness from the hops is discernable. M: It feels medium-bodied on the palate and very smooth due to the lack of carbonation. O: This beer is very easy to drink and is particularly sessionable given its low alcohol content.",2011-05-15,53373,Chester County Bitter

The taste is very lightly flavored with grains and some hops. The mouthfeel is very watery and kind of on the flat side. This beer along with a bunch of Sly Fox's releases just are not impressive to me. I feel bad saying that but I've not had a single one that really sticks out to me and makes me say ""Wow"".",2011-04-18,53373,Chester County Bitter
3.85,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Chester County Bitter has a dark golden body with a thin, spindly, tan head. Decent retention and lacing, the type you expect from a cask pour that is good, but not great. The aroma has some fruity hops and bready malts to it. The flavor has a noticeable hop bite to it, with zesty citrus and some other fruity hops. Slight bitterness and perhaps a touch of pine come from the hops also. The malt backbone balances nicely, and it is probably a little stronger than the hops. A very bready and grainy taste gives way to a bit of caramel-type sweetness. The beer finishes fairly dry. The mouthfeel is light with fairly low carbonation. I liked this one enough to have a couple pints of it. It's nice to find a tasty craft brew that is under 5% ABV, and a cask that is treated well is always a treat.",2011-03-20,53373,Chester County Bitter
4.18,4.0,3.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,"Served in a nonic pint glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically.  Appearance: As served the beer is a clear reddish golden brown in color with a ¼"" creamy head that persists for quite a while. Sipping leaves scattered legs or lacing. Smell: The aroma is soft and pleasant and includes some malt, some citrus zest and a touch of pine. While not strong the aroma is pleasant. Taste: The flavors include the caramel and toffee from the malt, traces of citrus zest and fruit with some light earthy character. There is quite a nice balance of malt and hops here. Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is medium bodied and smooth as silk with gentle but lasting carbonation. The finish is medium long with some ending hop bitterness.  Drinkability and Overall Impression: I enjoyed this one, finding that each sip followed naturally from the other. I certainly would be willing to have this one again.

S: Bready and roasted malt with a sweetness of vanilla, caramel, and toffee. Hops were orange peel and herbal with a touch of peppery spice in the nose. Looking for a bit more in the aroma but good. T: Lightly toasted malt and fresh bread, some vanilla and toffee add a mild sweetness. Orange peel and grapefruit from some PNW hops with a spicy European hop finish. Chamomile bitterness is in there too which ways in more than the sweet maltiness. M: Smooth and creamy, light to medium body. Subtle smooth carbonation as a good cask ale should have.

3.68,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,"On cask, via hand pump, @ the Sly Fox Brewing Company (Phoenixville, PA) on 12/20/10. Served in a 10 oz Pils glass. Pours a clear copper, with a finger of tight and foamy bright-white head. This retains with a thin creamy frothiness that leaves back spotty lacing which sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is grassy and a little spicy, with some bitter smelling citric character and a touch of earth. This is set against some malty tones of fresh baked biscuits and a dash of sweeter caramel in the nose.  The taste has both a fresh citric flavor and bitterness going on here and is balanced by a sturdy backbone of bready grains, which trails some leftover light toast into the finish, along with dry spice and rind. The mouthfeel is lighter-medium bodied, with a light prickle to the carbonation that runs through the middle of the feel, but is mostly easy on the edges and overall very smooth on the palate. This feels good on cask.  This was another pleasant enough quaff that I found on the hand pumps here at Sly Fox. This Bitter had some bite but was still mostly well balanced and the easy feel from the cask and lower ABV kept this drinking nicely. Sessionable little brew here.",2010-12-21,53373,Chester County Bitter

This is a beer that had a good bit of dry hopping either in fermentation or on cask, that really adds a nice woody, fresh hop aroma and flavor. The malt adds a bready character that helps ground the beer and provided the body that a smaller hopped beer requires.",2010-12-13,53373,Chester County Bitter

There's also some mild hops aroma. Taste is a little underwhelming. It's lacking body. But there is a lemon taste to it that is pleasing, but not overwhelmingly grabbing. The mouthfeel is nice and oily with almost no carbonation. It makes for a smooth drinking experience.  This beer is definitely sessionable, but I'm not sure I'd go that direction with this beer. It's good, but it doesn't bring enough to the table.",2010-12-11,53373,Chester County Bitter

3.48,4.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a growler into a tulip pint. Looks great--pitch perfect apple cider color. On the darker end of the range for the style, which is fine by me. Small ring of salmon roe popped up and popped out. Smells pretty, too--stiff green apples, some minty notes, faint faint earthiness. Smells restrained and refined. Taste proves the nose is false advertising. This is neither restrained or refined, and doesn't coax nearly enough out of the malt for my taste. There's a rough, unbalanced feel to the flavor profile, no doubt as a result of what seems like a heavy-handed hopping. The finish is just plain astringent, which I thought was because it was too cold, even though I didn't even refrigerate the growler. So I held it in my hands--I cradled this tender pint--but, sadly, it just became warmly astringent.  Mouthfeel, again, suffers from that astringency. Never quites attains that creamy buttery blanket for the juicy biscuit middle heaven that I like in bitters. Oh well. It's ok for an American version of the style. But American craft brewers are showing they don't do subtlety real well. Right now the English are kicking our asses in the bitter category.",2010-02-04,53373,Chester County Bitter

4.57,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,5.0,"I tried this on cask at Biercraft in Brooklyn. They had three fine beers on cask that evening, but this is the one I chose to take home in a growler. This beer was true to the style as an English Bitter, which can be hard to find here. It was subtley hopped and that refreshing, almost watery, follow through that is distinctive of a fine bitter. There was plenty of nice malt and hop flavor, and a pleasing ""bouquet"" throughout, but all around it had an air of understatement.  Went you want a big IPA or a hoppy Pale Ale, they can be found, and that's great. However, IMHO the more brewers can produce beers in this style, the better! I will definitely look for more from Sly Fox.",2009-12-06,53373,Chester County Bitter
3.73,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.0,"Appearance: dull copper color, slightly hazy at room temp, perhaps from dry hopping Aroma: earthy, spicy hops dominates, some caramel malt. Peach and pear esters. Would like more malt to hop balance for style (hoppy for english style) but quite pleasant Flavor: raisiny caramel malt and biscuit, typical for style. Resiny hop character from dry hop again a little out of style. Ditracs from rich maltiness. Would have preferred more end of boil hop addition as would have been less resiny. Mouthfeel: medium bodied, finishes dry. Rich cask mouthfeerl. Is there any other (good) way to drink a bitter? Overall: one of the best american bitters I've had, but a little too much hop, particularly dry hopping. Turns a fabulous beer into a good beer by throwing balance off a bit.

Frothy, soapy white head with excellent retention, only slowly fading to a thick lasting cap that leaves sporadic spots of lacing in it's path. Sweet light malt aroma with some subtle spice and light floral hops.  Clean, crisp and extremely smooth creamy body. Very drinkable with light sweet English malts, subtle spiciness and a very crisp clean floral hop flavor. The alcohol is very well balanced, considering this beer is 7% which is very high for a traditional English real ale. The fact that this beer is that high in ABV disqualifies it as a session beer but it drinks like one and is a very complex with a lot of full flavors. The hops really come through in the finish, but not in an overpowering or bitter fashion. This beer is very well balanced and an excellent American interpretation of the classic British style.

Some faint hint of herbal hops slightly, and some pine like bitterness. Pretty solid. Palate hits with a nice sweet mix of classic biscuit and soft caramel flavors. Good blending of sweetness and caramel tasting like malts it seems. Finish even has a light tea and herbal hop mix, with a hint of nice simple ""bitterness"" to match.

A nice-looking beer! Smell: slightly sweet malt aroma with plenty of caramel and a little bit of musty dustiness. All very proper, although not as enticing as I feel it could be. Taste: an interesting dry-sweet dynamic is going on here: it starts off dry, but in the middle is a shot of slightly sweeter caramel character and the finish is a lightly bitter and, again, dry element which is reminiscent to me of a dry Irish stout. Tasty enough, although this is definitely a subdued and workaday brew. Mouthfeel: medium body with quite a good carbonation and concomitant creaminess. It almost hits you like a nitro-widget can beer, but the richness and creaminess stick around far longer than a nitro brew. Quite good.

2.88,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,"Cain’s Finest Bitter is a tan colored brew with gold hues around the edges, a completely clear body, and a nose that is weak but offers aromas of pale, toasted malt, toffee, and some earthy hops. The appearance is rather ordinary, but not terrible and not enough to discourage that first sip. With the taste, Cains Finest Bitter offers flavors of brown sugar, toffee, biscuits, and some earthy hops. Digging further I am able to find some light nuttiness, herbal notes, and even a small amount of chocolate, but the latter taste sensation is probably pushing it as this is a fairly straight- forward English Bitter. This is a sweeter beer and many may be misled by the title, but one must remember that this is a British Bitter and when the English use the term, they mean something different from when Americans use the term. The taste actually has very little bitterness and even less alcohol. Its overall flavor profile may be a letdown to some, but it is actually a decent session beer and one worth a try every now and then when you want a lighter beer that still has at least some character.",2012-10-19,11361,Cain's Finest Bitter

3.23,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Picked up at Capone's for $3.75 a can. Poured into a Fuller's pint glass. Served just slightly chilled. I did a two-stage pour to try and develop a sizeable head and release much of the CO2 in hopes of replicating the cask mouthfeel. (As much as possible I guess.) The tan head maintained its sturdy structure for a minute or two, only to recede back to a thin white film on top. The body is a rich ruby amber color with pretty decent clarity.  The aroma is interesting. At first, I would describe it as metallic. The one beer this aroma reminds me of is Bud Light Lime. I know that most would consider that an insult, but I don't mean it to be one. It is tinny, with grainy huskiness, corn and maybe some English hops at the bottom of it all. I think it needs some cleaning up here... The sharpness of the aroma is NOT present in the flavor thankfully, and I get mostly sweet caramel malts on top of gentle cracker-like doughiness. Bitterness is there for balance only, and comes in at the end. Toasted, roasty, and slightly sweet.  The mouthfeel is very soft, and light bodied, with extremely low carbonation.

The color is medium caramel brown. Two fingers of buttery, light tan head dissipated slowly to leave an even skim. Smell: At first it smelled like corn adjunct, but then I thought otherwise: lots of pale and lightly toasted malts. There is a lot of caramel. Buttery biscuit, toffee, and grassy hops. Smells very British. Taste: Hybrid of adjunct and pale malts and lightly toasted caramel. It is thin but does have taste. Grassy hops give it a little bitterness. It is also sweet and fruity with flavors of apple. Drinkability: My British friend thinks it is “a crime against British beer” and “an abortion.” He suggests using it “for killing grass and weeds.” I think it is a decent, canned British beer.

Plenty of hop flavor up front being balanced by a nice toffee malt flavor. The flavor falls off a little too quick, but for a low ABV beer, I'm not complaining. Light bodied with low carbonation.

3.53,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"With so many British-influenced Pale Ales on the market, many of which fall well short of capturing the essence of true Bitters, it's refreshing to see well make and authentic examples infiltrating the craft beer market. Crystal clear to display a masculine copper-rich bronze glow, the Bitter's understated carbonation calmly builds a creamy and short-statured head that easily withstands the session and dispenses light evidence of lace. It's the classic look of English Bitters. Malty-rich aromas of caramel, sweet breads or biscuit, bread crust accompany the rich scent of medium kilned barley and starch. Slight earthiness rises from the hop balance with an almost-floral, but mostly herbal scents. Flavors also begin with a malt-rich taste that displays a proper taste of caramel, toffee, cola nut, sun kissed grains, bread crust, and malt starches. The sweetness of malt subsides at mid palate and allows for the rise of hops to balance with an earthy bitterness that seems somewhat woody or minty at times. Surprisingly low in fruity esters or buttery compounds helps to provide a crisp and clean session. Medium bodied throughout, but the early malt richness seems heightened and the lower carbonation allows the beer to sit on the tongue with more weight. But the malty textures subside and allow the hop bitterness to turn dry just as the slight warmth of alcohol keeps the beer crisp, dry, and refreshing in finish and aftertaste. Cains once again brews an effortless beer to drink. Very rewarding in the full flavor yet soft and elegant enough to carry and understated tone from nose to finish. Where intrigue and complexity is slight, refreshment and ease of consumption are high.",2012-03-27,11361,Cain's Finest Bitter

There is some nice caramel, toffee, and toast notes with some light butterscotch in the finish. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a velvety texture, and appropriately low carbonation. Overall, I really like the flavor of this beer, and its refreshing quality is hard to beat. I could see myself drinking this again when In the mood for something on the lighter side.

Stay tuned, kids, we'll be right back after these words from our sponsor. Hey kids, tired of drinking bland old milk? Why don't you try some BUPGOO? BUPGOO is a syrup that when added to milk makes the milk more attractive to children! BUPGOO works on the principle that children want what they cannot have. You see, BUPGOO in milk makes the whiteness rise foaming to the top of the glass, leaving a transparent brown liquid underneath. Yes, BUPGOO makes a glass of milk look EXACTLY like a glass of BEER! Next time you want that beer your parents drinking, ask 'em for BUPGOO! From the CAN: ""Imported British Beer"". The Crack also evidenced a minor offgassing of CO2, but nothing like the previous Dark Mild. The Glug had some cascading action, but nothing like the Dark Mild. I had best stop thinking about one vs. the other or this review will be seriously flawed. I had a mere finger of thick tawny head when I was done, like a crown atop the head of the beer. The color was a glorious deep-amber with NE-quality clarity and the BUPGOO allusion definitely applied! Nose had a grassy quality that reminded me of drying mown grass in the summertime. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a grassy hoppiness that was very tasty on the tongue. It was bitter, but not quite bitter enough for this self-avowed hophead. Finish was dry and refreshing and given its relatively low ABV, I could make an afternoon of it if I had to, but there may be better choices available.

Poured into a Black Sheep imperial pint glass. 4% abv; finally, a TRUE, Ding-approved English session bitter for the US! Served cool. Appearance: Crystal-clear dark copper beer, surprisingly high level of carbonation, and a dark ivory cap which fades to a nice, half-finger cap with good staying power. Smell: Hints of macro lager-like adjuncty business aren't real pleasant, but a few swirls brings out light caramel notes, with a bit of multigrain bread and light fruity esters. Those aromas are quite nice, just wish there wasn't that other kind of off-putting corn-y thing going on (for what it's worth, I have no idea if this is brewed with adjuncts or not). No real hop presence.  Taste: The taste is similar to the aromas in that there's both good and bad stuff going on. However, unlike the aromas, the negatives outweight the positives here. Some stale grainy flavors here, along with a slight macro lager-like sweetness, some unbalanced fruity notes, and then a bit of sweet (pleasant) caramel maltiness.  Mouthfeel: Served at traditional cask temperature, the mouthfeel is actually pretty smooth and nice; it doesn't feel harshly carbonated like I was afraid it would.  Overall: Wanted SO badly to like this. Their dark mild is actually pretty good, and my last trip to England has left me desperate (until I get better at homebrewing) for really tasty English-style session beers (imported or domestic).

Then comes a hint of malty caramel (surely the yeast used, eh?) and lastly you get a bit of flavor (no, not a citrusy flavor - perhaps a bit more bitterness?) of hops.  Drinkability: Yes :) Ok, it is quite drinkable in a certain context. Mmm. I would say that this would be the beer to drink with a meal.

SG: 12.0. 12 fl oz aluminum can with standard pull-tab served cold into a pilsner glass. Expectations are low on account of the brewery. Reviewed live. No bubble show forms as it's poured. APPEARANCE: Looks like an English pale ale. Boasts a mildly impressive ~3 inch head which retains for ~5-6 minutes and has nice creaminess and softness, with fair frothiness and fullness. Leaves no lacing as it recedes. Body is a translucent transparent copper of average vibrance. It's clean albeit a biteen murky, with no visible floating yeast particles. Appears well-carbonated. Pretty average across the board. AROMA: There is some mild buttery diacetyl off-character, suggestive perhaps that this might be a bitter instead of a pale ale, but the hop profile dictates otherwise, offering a fair challenge of floral hop character to the English malt backbone. Flaked malt leavens the body a bit, and pilsner malts are evident. The lightly bready buttery aromatics have me on edge regarding which style this beer actually is. English ale yeast is fairly obvious, but this aroma doesn't fit neatly into any one style. No alcohol is detectable. Aromatic intensity is average. TASTE: More English pale ale than bitter, though this does suffer from some obvious buttery diacetyl off-character. Malt backbone is comprised of pilsner malts, English pale malts, and flaked malts. The hop profile isn't notable, but does bring generic notes of floral hops. Lightly bready, with a definite English ale yeast guiding the beer and lending it natural cohesion. Shallow and simple as it is, it showcases English ale yeast uncommonly well for a Texas brew. It's not a gestalt beer, but I do like it in spite of its many shortcomings. Those hoping for an intricate or subtly executed brew will be disappointed, but it's decent as a generic English ale. TEXTURE: Smooth, wet, buttery, light to medium-bodied, problematically overcarbonated, and aptly hefty on the palate. Has sufficient thickness to support the flavour profile. This mouthfeel doesn't elevate the beer as a whole, nor does it accentuate specific notes (apart from the troublesome diacetyl), but it suits the taste decently. OVERALL: The diacetyl is mild enough that it kind of works, but this is a beer that doesn't know what it wants to be - apart from English. I've had worse, but the discerning drinker will be underwhelmed. More mediocre work from the cats at OTBC. Even the alcohol isn't well-hidden.

Feel: Low carbonation that starts creamy then goes gritty in the finish. Overall. I don't think CAMRA would approve as this is in the can. I had the pleasure of having this on tap and it was much improved by the change in format. Even in the can there is a taste of London.

My in-person trader, tone77, has moved away but the mighty JenRay down in Houston, TX keeps me in business. She only wants hoppy beers like APAs, AIPAs, DIPAs, but they are pretty easy to find in CANs and she knows that I am indiscriminate, so I get all sorts of CANs in return. From the CAN: ""OTXBC""; ""High in the Hill Country""; "" A bright Texas session ale made with copious amounts of English Challenger hops and a classic English yeast strain - this beer is sure to make you feel right at home, no matter where you find yourself.""; ""All Year Beer""; ""Keep Cold""; ""Deep in the Heart at Oasis Texas Brewing Co. 78732 Texas U.S.A."" I've never been to London, so I CAN't really be homesick for there. I have been to many parts of Texas, however, and while I am not homesick for any of them, I always think of the late, great Jim Thompson when I think of Texas (and Oklahoma). Enough poetic waxing! The Crack! was nice and loud so I celebrated with an inverted Glug. This caused the formation of two-plus fingers of dense, rocky, eggshell-white head with decent retention. I was fascinated to watch it slowly fall, leaving dense, sticky lacing in its wake. Who is going to clean that up? Color was a hazy Amber (SRM = &gt; 7, &lt; 9). The nose initially struck me as odd - woody and tea-like, until I looked at Hopunion's description which mentions ""[c]edar and green tea"". I really must learn to close my eyes and trust in The Force. The cedar was really prevalent, underlain by the tea. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was the invert. It was very tea-like, initially, with the cedar underneath. The finish was semi-dry and the cedar flavors lingered well after the swallow. This made for a nice, mellow wrap-up to a day of mostly low-ABV, low-IBU beers. It really put me in mind of Celestial Seasonings' Sleepy Time Tea. I never really got dressed today, so I am ready to go upstairs and drift into Slumberland. Would this be optimal under other circumstances?

I encourage you not to let the BA score discourage you from giving this beer a chance, especially if you can appreciate a solid English-style ale now and then.

London Homesick pours a clean, dark yellow from the can with one sturdy finger of head. A cap remains throughout the life of the beer. 

Fresh-ground grain dominates the nose, rounded out by subtle European hops. As expected, the aroma does not punch you in the face. Once you begin sipping, this beer does not last long--light and crisp without being watery. Hops dance around the edges without destroying your palette. If you just view this beer as a bitter, I think you really admire how tight Oasis's recipe and process seems to be. 

On the whole, I think Oasis hit this one out of the park. I have yet to drink anything else from them, but this particular offering stands out among most other recent Austin/Texas upstarts.

The nose is light-medium in intensity: zwieback-like toasted malt over a rich, deep blend of boozy, sweet Concord grapes and earthy pipe tobacco. The palate is more assertive than the nose: bitter, earthy hops ride atop a toasty malt foundation that shows hints of dark fruit, caramel and alcohol. The finish is clean and has a nice, crisp carbonation bite, followed by the onset of a modest earthy bitterness that lingers for a few minutes. While the bitterness outweighs the malt character, the malt is well-represented and the bitterness is not overbearing; I'd say this beer is properly balanced for the style.

Nice use of aromatic hops, while the malt and bitterness are well balanced. Live yeast adds depth to the flavour. Drinkable and worth sampling.",2011-07-26,21076,Bitter

3.73,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"A Fin Du Monde tulip serves as the recepticle for this English bitter. The label states this is real ale, meaning as I understand it that it is live beer and unfiltered. The pour reveals a bone white head atop a deep honey colored beer that is just a bit hazy. Lacing is good and retention is not too long. The nose is citrusy and not too pronounced. Malt is present in light sweetness but this is a clean smelling beer. Taste is bitter, as promised, but not out of balance. There is a good malt flavor of sweet biscuit and a medium-light body that carries the flavors well. The carbonation is light and the aftertaste lasts with the malty flavors. This is a great example of what a session beer can and, in my opinion, should be. It is full of flavor and refreshing, lightly carbonated, and still living and containing all of its richness as opposed to having that all stripped out of it by filtering and pasteurization. Very drinkable, if a bit more expensive than I would like. Come on America, make me a beer like this one so I can enjoy it without paying for the shipping from Britain.

3.98,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,"500ml bottle, and yeah, 4.0%abv Bitter so that make it an official Session beer. Label has this on it: BBF 24 6 10 so I'm thinking that translates to best before June 24, 2010. A slightly hazy light gold colour with about an inch of foam. There's not much of any bubble activity. The smell is a nice balance between sweet malts and light citrus hops(the label says Challenger &amp; Boadicea, the latter I've never heard of) Bottom line re the smell is that it smells very much a brew coming from the UK. I'm expecting good things with the taste. The taste has a very nice hoppy bitter flavour that is countered by some sweetish notes from the malt and a light fruitiness that I'm guessing is very cherry like. I notice it more when I swish the beer in my mouth but without swishing, it is still there. I'm liking this English Bitter. Plenty of flavour for the abv. It borders on medium bodied but I'd still call it light, the carbonation is medium..could be restrained just a tad more but works. Good mouthfeel. Drinkability? Great drinkability and why the hell not! Low in alcohol and plenty of flavour. What's not to like? I wish I had picked up more than 1 bottle.",2010-05-16,21076,Bitter
3.68,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,"This beer seems to fit the English bitter style reasonable well. It is a light bodied, and light flavored beer.  Has a hops bitterness to the flavor without much more complexity. This beer would be a fine summer's day refresher-- served slightly chilled-- or even cold. The traditionally low ABV makes the beer quite drinkable. The mouthfeel is cordial but the beer itself is light bodied so it didn't make much of an impression on me.  I could however quaff a few pints of this and enjoy the experience. Furthermore I wouldn't be welded to my seat in the way the higher ABV beers and many of the more robust flavored beers affect me (and probably anyone else). The beer has a very light nose- emitting a tad of hops and not much else. All in all-- I don't have any complaints-- it's not particularly memorable, but there aren't too many bones to pick with in the English bitter style.  Perhaps the only issue is $6 a pint... there are a lot of fine beers out there on which I can drop $6.. so this one has a lot of competition.",2010-04-18,21076,Bitter

Appearance: Pours out a clearish, light orange-hued body akin to dehydrated tangerine peels. Topped with a ½ inch head of lasting, whitish foam. Smell: Though not boldly so, the aroma is predominately hoppy, with notes of spice, citrus, and dried herbs along with secondary scents of pale malts and a light hint of a fruity English yeast. Taste: Modestly sweet, mild tones of Maris Otter malt with just a hint of toffee. Pinch of lemon peels tossed with a light dose of spice and a tea-like herbaceousness from the hops. Ample amount of balancing bitterness. Touch of additional fruitiness. A bit more toffee on the back end. There's a little surge of bubbles on the drying finish. Mouthfeel: Medium-light body. A skosh above medium carbonation.

Mild to none lacing that randomly sticks to edges of glass. S- Mild sweet tropical fruits are noticed upfront with a then light grassy nole close by. Slight malts as well. T-M- The bottle conditioning causes the yeasty flavor to come out in the beginning that is soon turned to light bitter sweet hop flavors. Not to much bitterness as I expected more. All and all a good all-round light bitter beer. Has a little astringent feel but barely noticeable to me due to heavy hop overdoses on regular occation. Fresh mouthfeel is the best way to describe.

Smell: Yeasts are definitely prominent; some citrusy cleanness and freshness, with faint grass-like aromas and overall sourness.  Taste: A bit bland and unassuming at first, light notes of apple-like fruits and almost a tulip-y taste. Bready and malty to the mouth. This is followed by a very prominent sourness, somewhat like lemons or vinegar; or, for that matter, lemon-flavored vinegar. Ends on a slightly bitter hop note.

Big bread/biscuit flavors envelope the palate as the beer is drunk and linger for a moment. Some faint sweet maltiness lingers in the back of the brew, never really pulls through. Good herbal hop flavors come in, provide a gentle bitterness and intermingle with some grainy astringency as the beer is swallowed. Nice, dry finish with a lingering taste of bready malts and a light bitterness.  Light bodied with a good carbonation to match, this beer is an easy drinker. Save for the price, a great session ale.

A tight frothy head, not too big for the aggressive pour I gave it, but very thick with clinging clumpy lace. This beer is wonderfully clear, only upon close inspection can I see any sign of bottle conditioning. Color is a pale-yellow amber. Earthy hops are the prevalent aroma I'm assuming a Fuggles addition. Also some sour notes. not much of a pickup of malts in the smell. Taste is straightforward, bitter enough and balanced well. My tongue is puckered up as it should be. Subtle malt taste witch surprises me a bit as this is a UK import but tastes like an American bitter in that it's balance is weighted heavily toward the hop additions. I do pick up a bit of corn or another vegetable, it's not entirely out of place but I do consider it a defect. Good clean finish. Good mouthfeel, biting carbonation that matches the bittering hops well. Pretty thin, barely coating the tongue. I would call this beer mighty drinkable.  This brew is refreshing and clean, very bitter with malt that will stand up to it but not a malt lovers bitter.

4.1,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,"Sun-faded tangerine with a fine yeasty haze visible only with bright sunlight. There's actually more head than beer in the glass immediately after the pour, presumably due to a generous number of bottle-conditioned bubbles. And what a good looking lid it is too. Eggshell with a faint orange tint, fluffy (yet firm enough to be rocky) and sticky enough to lay down scads of lace. My impression of English bitters is that they're fairly well-balanced with a nod toward the hoppy side of things... and that is just how Ridgeway Bitter smells. I've run across Challenger hops many times, but never Boadicea (a new aphid-resistant strain). Even though the aroma is on the mild side, enough of the lemon peel, lemongrass and lemon pepperiness of the hops comes through for me to find plenty of enjoyment. Simply delicious. Sometimes it's hard for me to put my big beer love aside and appreciate a lowercase beer such as Ridgeway Bitter. I didn't have any trouble at all recognizing the beauty of Bluebird Bitter and I'm not having the least bit of difficulty here either. The key, I believe, is that both are clean and hop-focused. The flavor is basically a reprise of the aroma. A sufficient amount of Maris Otter malt provides an understated hint of sweetness and coddles the suprising bitterness of the veddy, veddy English hops. If Boadicea is the cause of this wonderful grassy pepperiness, then count me among its admirers. What the hell do aphids know anyway? This is scrupulously clean beer that is one of the best true session ales that I've had in a long, long time. The body/mouthfeel is unapologetically light, but still manages to fill the mouth with each upending of the glass. An energetic amount of carbonation helps in that regard and is a perfect match for the rest of the beer's attributes. While I don't love Ridgeway Bitter as much as I love Ridgeway IPA (once a hophead, always a hophead), it's a beautiful beer that is the very definition of the English bitter style, at least as I understand it. I would dearly love to work my way through a succession of pints, on-cask of course, during a warm sunny afternoon in Oxfordshire.",2006-10-05,21076,Bitter
3.88,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Presentation: 500ml brown glass bottle with a wide body and thin proboscis-like neck. Sealed with a metallic green crown cap and labeled as Ridgeway Bitter bottle conditioned ale. Alc. 4% Vol. My bottle is just as the one pictured in the BA Avatar. Appearance: Superb presentation, glowing soft orange amber body with some light brown tissue. Massive off-white head rises prominently and leaves some spectacular looking lacing. Excellent catwalk looks. Nose: Gorgeous nose, sweet malts, hints of Devon toffee and teasing bitterness of the English kind. Monkey nut pockets here and there. Taste: Gentle malt tingling with some residual cold tea to line the cheeks. Sharp angles in this one, the malts and hops are in two camps, both joined together by a dry bitter finish with hints of nuttiness. Splashes of lemon and tobacco leaves ridge the back of this brew. English bitterness rides from start to finish. Mouthfeel: Soft conditioning throughout, Cask-like almost, light body with a satisfying feel. Low feel but high body, if you know what I mean. Drinkability: A quaffing Pale Ale that holds no qualms or grudges, easy to put down and easier to pick up again. Overall: A very interesting English Pale Ale; the Marris Otter Malt is no surprise but the mix of Challenger and Boadicea hops most certainly is. Solid stuff.",2006-08-13,21076,Bitter

Aroma is malty and a little floral. Light, malty flavor, somewhat herbal and possessing an oddly astringent character. There's a strange bitterness that doesn't come across as hop bitterness. The beer struck me as strangely dry for a english bitter, as though the malt couldn't keep up with some of the other nuanced flavors. All in all, feels a bit unbalanced. The slight, tangy sharpness feels at odds with the smooth characteristics that I expect from english bitter, impeding drinkability.",2006-06-24,21076,Bitter

Aroma is rather subdued, slightly earthy, maltiness, some tinges of hoppiness. Malty , earthy tastes dominate, then a slight hoppy tatse and a longer lasting hop after tate, perhaps from the fresh hops. Pretty thin on the palte, well carbonated. A good drinkable bitter, but at the price we pay over here i could not say it was a session ale..but if in Oxford this would keep my intrest for several pints.",2006-05-27,21076,Bitter
4.09,3.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,"I swirled the yeast in the bottle resulting in a cloudy, golden-amber hued beer. Massive white head, at the apex the foam was four fingers tall. Thankfully, the head subsided to a more manageable two fingers of head after a few moments. The head retention wasnt all that impressive. Sadly, there was no subsequent lacing. Bummer. Overall, I like the appearance.  Lovely nose, perfumed flowers with faint citrus notes and lemongrass. I absolutely love the malt aromas. Maris Otter malt is a gift from the beer gods. Biscuits and caramel, the aromas are very rich and deep. The nose isnt balanced as the malt steals the show but I detect the hops in the background. The aromas are wonderful and yet so simple. Hops and malt and little else, its terrific. Moderate potency and it says all the right things. Inviting! The palate is a perfect replica of the nose. Lemongrass and citrusy hops with a tickle of flowers; light bitterness. However, the biscuits and caramel grains are so very tasty. The finish isnt all the good though; it is kind of flat and metallic. While it is not a negative it doesnt allow the lovely maltiness to linger. The aftertaste is a mix of flowers and lemongrass. For an English Bitter I really like this beer. Medium/medium-light in body, low but natural carbonation, the mouthfeel is quite agreeable. It is relaxing but not sluggish.  Well, this is very easy to drink. At 4% I could session with this beer easily. I wonder if I can get this in Omaha. Ive seen other Ridgeway beers. Anyway, I really like the simplicity this beer offers. It really hit the spot. Thank you Daniel for the bottle, I liked it a plenty.",2006-05-19,21076,Bitter

Mouthfeel: Moderate carbonation, smooth and light-bodied with a light dryness in the finish. Drinkability: Really easy to drink.

Possibly Fuggles? Taste &amp; mouthfeel: Crisp and fizzy with a dry malty attack. The bitterness kicks in halfway through the sip and kind of ... lasts. No distinct hop flavor. The body is thin and even a bit watery, but the bitterness persists and makes the aftertaste seem a shade imbalanced.

Pours a bright amber/copper that is perfectly clear and it's topped with a fleeting off-white 1 finger head. The color is beautiful but the head is lacking (dirty glass?). It smells grassy/spicy with grapes, pineapple?, diacetyl?, toasty malts, and other, perhaps tropical, fruit notes. It has a medium body and tastes grassy/spicy/leafy and maybe some skunky from the hops. It's followed by a good bitterness, fruits, pineapple?, and maybe some citric/herbal qualities.

3.46,4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,"Served from the engine at Moan &amp; Dove. Clear, bright gold, a couple stray bubbles half-heartedly trying to form the semblance of a collar, leaving the beer entirely naked after a couple sips. Nearly no aroma, probably due to the lack of head. A vague floral, melon-ish fruity whiff. What is there is decent enough. The flavor opens with a mild, very easy drinking pale maltiness. Toasty, with a touch of minerally flavor and a bit of bacterial funkiness. Slightly infected cask? Subtle, melon-like fruit, easing into a passive, floral hop finish. That bit of funkiness isn't bad, but the slight, vague sourness in the finish kinda ruins the drinkability for me. It's such a delicate beer that it overpowers the other flavors very easily. Great carbonation level, just a soft sparkle, pleasant when coupled with the light body. Smooth drinkin' stuff. Light, yet flavorful, this is what session ale is all about. I just wish it were a bit cleaner. I'll definitely try it again next time I see it.",2005-12-24,21076,Bitter

Malt profile is quite brief, astringent lemon tones take over, senses of pepper, arugala, even cilantro. Finishes thinner but with a lot of the excessive carbonation still in effect.

3.43,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.25,"Served on tap in a pint glass Appearance – The beer is served a very hazy amber color with a one finger head of a light cream color. The head has a good level of retention, slowly fading to leave a moderate level of lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma of the beer is on the grainier side with a lightly toasted bready smell mixed within. Along with these smells are some aromas of caramel and a little bit toffee as well as the slightest hint of a citrus hop smell. Taste – The taste begins with a toasted bready taste with some sweeter flavors of caramel and toffee. The sweeter flavors begin losing ground as the taste moves on with the bready flavor taking on a more roasted cracker like taste. As this occurs some hop flavors of a citrus and grassy nature come to the tongue. While the sweetness lessens from the start, it is still quite detectable with it never really leaving a “dry” beer. In the end with the transitions in the taste, one is left with a very lightly hopped, moderately sweet, cracker taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is average in terms of its thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is on the average side. The average carbonation and body are both quite appropriate as they uphold the lightly hopped flavors of the brew, all while still maintaining an easy drinking base for the sweeter flavors of the brew.

Anyway, it is definitely worth a try regardless if you can get a hold of it.",2011-06-12,10094,Colonel Blides Cask Ale
3.93,3.5,3.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,a: orange brown color. almost a little cloudy but not too bad. toasted golden might be a better way to describe the color. not much head to this guy. s: rather tame with the smell. very balanced but some slight hop notes reach out. t: I can taste way more hops in it than I can smell. Still balanced but this bottle definitely had a more aggressive hop profile than I remember it having last year. m: this beers finishes very dry and I love it. I think it is just something I've expected from the style.  o: Overall I think this is one of the better brews I've had from a NJ brewery. Even though my experience at the Cricket Hill brewery was far from spectacular I still think a lot of their beers are solid.,2011-04-14,10094,Colonel Blides Cask Ale
2.8,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,Have had several beer from this brewery and this one sounded like it would be pretty tasty. The pour was pretty standard for me with a some decent head on it and an amber colored body. The beer wasn't much more than a regular English Bitter. The flavor is on the dry and malty side. Not much hop aromas of taste coming from this one. For me this beer was just average and not much more. Just another English Bitter.,2011-04-08,10094,Colonel Blides Cask Ale
4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"started to pour this one into the glass, it became quickly obvious that it was going to be a voracious pour, so I quickly slowed it down, but even still, it took two times to get the full bottle into the glass. A huge head, almost immeasurable in size formed on the top and quickly spilled over down the sides of the glass. Very vigorous and lively pour here. The color was bright amber yellow, somewhat hazy and cloudy, but very light and bright. There was tons of carbonation visible throughout the entire glass, which really kept up throughout the entire session. Nice light yeast and fruity characters coming out right away. Some light smells of peaches, bananas, light cereal grains, and grasses were all picked up right away. Very bright aroma, here for sure. Really a nice tight profile and seemed to be very nice. A touch spicy in the back end I was starting to pick up, and some muted hop aromas, though nothing terribly extreme here. Lots of light cereal grains, light fruit, bananas, peach, a hint of lemon perhaps, all mingling in together and giving it a very light flavor. Hints of grass coming through now along with a slightly muted hop profile are really starting to make this one pop now. The finish was crisp, clean and quick, straight to the point. A nice sharp cutoff of light grassy hops gave way to a lingering flavor of light grain. Super light bodied and very highly carbonated would be the best way to describe this one. The feel was extremely light, classic for a blond ale, and much lighter then even a pale ale would be. Huge carbonation profile really helped it go down effortlessly, with a smooth clean and crisp finish.",2011-02-26,10094,Colonel Blides Cask Ale

T: The taste starts out with a nice hops bitterness that isn't over-powering. Then a hearty malt character comes in along with mildly sweet flavors of caramel, citrus and nuts creating a good balance. The after-taste is slightly bitter. M: Crisp and smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.

Cricket hill is a self pronounced ""Gateway"" brewery into the craft world, so I wasn't expecting much from this offering, but I was pleasantly surprised by the way they hit this style right on.

4.15,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,"From a Firkin at The Grey Lodge Pub in Philly. I think this is my first Cricket Hill Beer ever. Colonel Blide looks nice, nice in that a nice bright white sudsy head stays on top throughout the ride. Sticking is minimal but it's there if you look for it. For a English Bitter this is much darker than other versions. Id say a bright brown with gold within sets the mood. Smell is quite sweet but not cloyingly so. I get a bunch of apple, slight pear with caramel in small spirts. A nice earthy hop background keeps it together. I never experienced a bitter with such a fruity component and Im liking it. The usual bitter characteristics are there including pale malt(muted), bready morning food, and a touch of grain. The fruit is a added bonus and apple and pear are up there with some others following. The feel is spactacular and smooth with a minimal bite of carbonation, that's barely noticable. A medium bodied bitter with uummmpppphhh. I really liked this and I had another. Very easy to drink but not that easy to find, I never saw this anywhere in the philly area, or even heard of it.

Still, it was a subtle and well-balanced beer. Up front there were toasted mildly nutty barley, which were then backed by floral, herbal citrus hops that I couldn't quite place as either American of British. Still I think this beer would fit in just fine at an English pub, the body was, light, drinkable, and true to style.

Really pretty. Aroma is very creamy and has a orange sorbet undertone. Also has a bready rye component. The taste is very smooth and fruity. Dry esters of fruit come through with a bitterness that give this beer a nice bite. This is one of my favorite cricket hill beers next to their jersey summer ale.

Mouthfeel: Pretty light, with a lingering bitterness. Drinkability: See comments below.  Overall: I wasn't bowled over by this, but I could see where it might improve if it were poured fresh from a cask. Pretty run of the mill though it wasn't horrible by any stretch.

There is more hop bitterness than was suggested by the nose, but this beer is still quite sweet, finishing dry with a lingering aftertaste. A medium- to full-bodied beer with sticky texture and soft carbonation. Colonel Blide is very enjoyable and quickly consumed in the heat or a shoulder season. This one has enough character to sustain one's interest. I was dubious of this, being labeled a cask ale in a bottle, but pleasantly surprised.

3.04,4.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,"12 oz. bottle that has a plain and simple black label of a red and orange oval with the name of the beer in big bold white letters, the outline of a white cricket in a black background at the top, and a star at the bottom. Off to the sides is just the refund values and the Government warning. A best before date on the bottle would have been nice, but I guess not. Can you really call a bottled beer a Cask Ale? Probably not. When poured into a Troegs pint glass, this ""Cask Ale"" had the same clarity of a true Cask Ale. It was a very hazy beer with quite a few carbonation bubbles racing to the top of the glass. For the color of the beer, it was a golden orange with a small tint of amber along the sides. On top of this beer was a small clean white sock colored creamy head of foam. It had decent retention that left behind a tiny white skim of foam and a few minor spots of lace around the glass. I know nobody cares, but I really liked the color of Colonel Blide's. The head of foam wasn't, but at least it had the color and clarity going for it. There wasn't much going on in the aroma department. It was a lightly fruity beer with a subtle whiff of hops at the end. I swirled it around and around to try and wake the aroma, but nothing happened. If anything, the swirling diminished the aroma. That sucked!  There was a little more going on in the taste than in the aroma, but that's not saying much. There was at least more of a hop presence in the taste. The taste starts off with a little fruityness and then it goes into a mild citrus hop bitterness. After the hops pass on by, the taste then finishes up with a subtle taste of toasted malts. it didn't have a bad taste. It's just that there wasn't much going on in here. This was a light bodied beer with its fair share of carbonation and a peppery aftertaste of bitter hops and toasted malts.  This beer had two things going for it, the appearance and the price. Colonel Blide's had a solid appearance with nothing all that much going on it either the aroma or taste. It's a good thing that this beer is pricey or moderately priced. If it was either of them, I would be kicking myself right now. As of right now, you can more than likely pick up a bottle for less than $2 but more than $1.50.",2009-11-22,10094,Colonel Blides Cask Ale

I was thinking this was a blonde, not an ESB, but I like it either way. Not really bitter, but a damn tasty beer.

I was disappointed. The malt tastes were muted. The hops dominated (not in an IPA sort of domination, but dominant none the less). They did seem to have a nice hopping. In other words, it wasn't a Cascade-style ESB. But the malt just didn't provide the balance to the hops and lacked the complexity I expect in the best ESBs.

4.73,4.5,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Cricket Hill Colonel Blide's is best described as an English style Bitter, although it is not quite in any particular style.  It is an unfiltered, dry-hopped ale that was originally sold to bars for use in casks. As a result, the beer is less carbonated than the other beers in the line, and less carbonated than a typical bottled beer. This is an attribute some, including me, absolutely love as it contributes to its exceptional drinkability. It is intended to be a session beer, as ALL Cricket Hill beers are. The idea is to create a flavorful beer made with quality ingredients (water, hops, barley malt, and yeast) with balanced hops and malt without overbearing alcohol or hop character.  Colonel Blide's has a fantastic pink grapefruit peel character from the hops. The beer slides down your throat easily, and at the end of a pint calls for another. The nose isn't heavy, but it is somewhat floral. The color is a beautiful orangey amber, deep and slightly opaque.  Many bars in New Jersey have put this beer on their draught lines under their house name, like Cloverleaf Tavern.

Nothing about this beer impressed me until I sipped it. Excellently balanced taste. Cricket Hill continues to impress me for a small local brewery. Lots of citrus notes there, some lemon and grapefruit topped with a hop punch akin to that of an IPA. I would actually almost consider this an IPA. Finishes hoppy/bitter.

3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Picked this up here in town this week because it said ""cask ale"" on the bottle and I was a bit intrigued by it. I've had beers on cask before, but I wasn't quite sure why this had that as part of the name. If it was meant to be served on cask, then the warm temperature which I had this beer pretty much explains the rationale behind it. It wasn't anything terrible, but at the same time, this is a pretty decent bitter and certainly worthy of being on cask at a watering hole around here. The pour was characterized by a tall, frothy head and a nice, almond hue. There wasn't much lacing and the mouthfeel was pretty much what I thought it would be - balanced, smooth, and hoppy in the back. There is some citrus here, with malted notes that are leathery and warming in mouthfeel. Everything fits together well here, but this isn't terribly complex or introspective. It's a good beer that reminds me of something I'd have in England - a standard old-style ale.  I have no idea what the alcoholic content of this is, but this would make a decent session beer. I only found this being sold by the bottle, which is fine for those nights like this when it's too cold outside for a given time of the year. Aficionados of Cricket Hill will love the hint of their hops in the aftertaste, and the next time I get over to Fairfield, I'll have to see if they have this on tap there.

T: The flavor begins with wet lemons with flashes of sweet caramelized grains. Light hints of sour orange peels are evident as well. The hopping was moderately strong, much more so then the nose lead on, while the finish finds a nice wet citrus twang of grapefruit.

The first one I had was loaded with big floaties. The next was absolutely clear which leads me to believe I may have had the last one out of the cask. I especially considered that explanation when it took about 10 minutes to get my beer. A marvelous aroma of floral hops with some sweet malts in there. A bit of citrus is also in there. If you are familiar with Cricket Hill beers, you know that crisp citrus aroma associated with Rick's brews.  An absolutely silky creamy smooth brew. Oh, do I love cask brews. The body was pretty full, and the flavor was right there. Floral hops to bitter a bit balanced with a nice sweet maltiness. Little hints of citrus here and there. Although my two glasses appeared very different, the flavoring was not really different. The first one with sediment was a bit more earthy, but it really did not stray away from the other too much.

Opens with a loud hiss, and the sound of bubbling nitrogen. Poured into a tulip pint glass; the full-on Guinness 'settling' effect lasts for a couple of minutes. A clear golden colour with very faint carbonation. Yields a vast head of creamy white foam with superb retention; it just stays there as I drink. The aroma is barely there - mild hints of grain, caramel, ale yeast esters and stewed hops. A slight background staleness. Incredibly bland. Tastes of weak caramel malt with a stale finish. Some yeast esters and a whisper of stewed hops lurking turgidly in the background. Faintly sweet, with an almost imperceptible bitterness and a harsh, solventy hint upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth with a decent creamy body, but the lack of carbonation detracts from the texture - the result is flat and insubstantial. Mild aftertaste of stewed hops and yeast esters. Appalling - utter, utter shit. This easily ranks as one of the worst beers I've ever had the displeasure of imbibing; even most macro lagers come over better. Virtually tasteless and without aroma. What little can be detected is horrid, while the body leaves much to be desired (like a corpse). This is bad on so many levels, it should be considered a crime against humanity.

To call this bland is unfair to bland stuff; this is just rubbish and although I’m sure the liquid in the can had been shown some hops and malts: they didn’t actually get to meet each other long enough before they were boiled to death and pasteurised. This is great pity because when this beer was formally brewed at the Strangways Brewery it was a lovely bitter, didn’t travel too well but in its heartland you couldn’t have asked for a better pint of cask bitter.

Can pick out a little hoppiness if I concentrate. The feel is nasty. This is flatter than most cask ales and without the attendant bonus in flavour.

I was looking for a new beer to try and I thought I would take a chance on this one, so lets see how it goes. 2015 Vintage. Poured from a brown 11.2 oz bottle into a imperial pint glass. A- The label is has a nice clean and simple looks and it's not too eye catching. It poured a nice amber orange color that took on more of an amber color when held to the light with a finger and a half worth of bubbly off white head that died down to a thin ring that stayed till the end and it left a little bit of patchy lacing behind. This is a pretty nice looking beer, I have no complaints. S- The aroma starts off with a slightly higher amount of medium sweetness with a creamy aroma being the first to show up and it leads into some fruity yeast which imparts a slight dark fruit aroma. Up next comes the hops which impart some a little bit of fruity, herbal and citrus rind aromas. This beer has a good aroma, it's unique and I have no complaints.  T- The taste seems to be fairly similar to the aroma, it starts off with a slightly higher amount of medium sweetness with the fruity yeast being the first to show up with some eniglish ale like flavors along with a little bit of a stone fruit like flavor. Up next comes the malts which impart some grainy and sweet malt like aromas and towards the end comes the hops which impart those citrus rind and herbal aspects that I got in the aroma and it had a higher amount of light bitterness with a lemon, stonefruit and slight herbal hop aftertaste. This is a pretty nice tasting beer, there's not off flavors and and the different aspects work well together.  M- Smooth, a little crisp, a little clean, medium bodied wit a lighter amount of medium carbonation. The mouthfeel is nice, but it could use just a little more carbonation.  Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and I thought it was a good example of an English Bitter, it had pretty much all the aspects that I look for in the style and I ended up enjoying it. This beer had nice drinkability, I could drink a couple of these. What I like the most about this beer is the balance, it was good and just where I want it to be. What I like the least about this beer is the carbonation, it could use just a little more. I would buy this beer again and I would recommend trying it. All in all I was happy with this beer and I thought it was a little unique.

S: sweet tangerine-ish citrus hops come with rather intensely sweet pale malts and syrup, added with a hint of butterscotch-like yeasty influence. As it warms the yeastiness comes at the expense of the other elements on nose. T: yeastiness in the form of lactose-drink accompanies the main entry of lightly burned pale malts (with an edge of fig paste, slightly like a thinly-sweet edge of a pasteurised ale to be honest...), sweet citric taste (a bit like the undertone of tangerine syrup), thin-bodied bitter-sweet tea, leading towards a lightly dry/tannic and bitter finish that doesn't go without a subtly sour edge of more yeastiness.

Odd mix of earthy, leafy hops and some citrus - lemon and orange blanketed under a sweet honeyish malt. It almost works to a degree, but doesn't. The hops are nearly lost to the malt, which itself doesn't lend much flavor to it. The carbonation that is not too noticeable in the appearance interferes and give it something of a seltzer-water aftertaste. It has a sweetish, fleeting finish. The body thins even when warm, though there is something of a creaminess to it, but not enough to quite make up for the thin body and late carbonation feel. It not undrinkable despite odd blend that is ironically helped by its mildness. But, it's nothing worthwile, IMO. It's a nice idea in theaory to blend British (Challenger?) and American (Mt.

2.54,4.5,3.0,2.0,3.5,2.0,"The pour is absolutely fantastic - the bottle conditioning gives this beer lots and lots of carbonation resulting in a huge sticky white head. Even with a gentle pour I had to give the beer time to settle down before filling the glass. The beer itself is a cloudy deep yellow - almost hefe like in appearance. The nose is rather tangy and tart with strong hints of lemon masking most of the hop notes. There is a light floral note suggesting some interesting hopping. While I'm all for experimenting and the thought of an English Pale Ale hopped with an ""American"" hop sounds intriguing, the result is far from satisfying. Primarily because the yeast hasn't produced much of an English PA flavoring - no fruit and no caramel notes at all. Instead the yeast has taken over and you've got a flavor much closer to a hefe or Belgian blonde with obvious banana, clove and lemon flavors dominating. There is some hopping in the background but the yeast completely dominates and takes this completely out of either EPA or APA style ranges. The mouthfeel is good with the bottle conditioning adding plenty of carbonation and a smooth feel. No bittering from the hops because the sourness overwhelms. Would I drink this again? Only if someone told me this was a bottling mistake at the brewery. From the coloration (no reds or ambers to be found) to the nose (no caramels) to the taste (no fruity esters) this is not in the least an English Pale Ale.

The foam is yellowish ivory, is airily stiff and sports hundreds of large, gem-like bubbles on its upper surface. This is not the type of cap that will deposit much lasting lace, although a few skinny fingers are arrayed haphazardly along the nonic bulge. I like the nose. The beer smells exactly like what it is, namely a pale ale brewed with English (Challenger) and American (Mt. Hood) hops. Hard to say which one is the most aromatic, it's a virtual dead heat. Slightly floral, moderately spicy and nicely citric fruity. There's also a suprising amount of diacetyl that leads to an enjoyable (in this case at least) buttered breadiness. Not the flavor that I was expecting. There's something amiss here, though I'm not sure that I'll be able to identify what it is. The beer is insufficiently malted and lacks any sort of softness or creaminess whatsoever. In fact, it's borderline harsh in the mouth. The sweetness that builds throughout each mouthful and leaves a tacky residue on the finish tastes like added sugar, akin to lemonade, rather than malt. Speaking of lemonade, the flavor is more citric sour than hoppy bitter. Looking at the listed ingredients for Bluebird Bitter versus this XB version, one realizes that they really aren't that dissimilar. The main differences are that the original uses Maris Otter malt and this beer uses Mt. Hood hops in addition to Challenger. Why then do the beers taste so different? I love BB for its subtle, drinkable charm. XB lacks those very qualities. The mouthfeel is too thin to be enjoyable, even with the mildly sticky, mouthcoating finish. Some of the harshness fades as the boisterous bubbles begin to die, but the mouthfeel is still no great shakes. Fans of Bluebird Bitter are hereby warned to avoid this beer. It isn't very good and it certainly isn't as advertised. Coniston's hope of a more highly hopped, American-style pale ale with English roots (a fantastic idea by the way) fails in the execution.

Not a lot of lace though, mostly dots (much better in the second pour, as it warms). Pleasant mild citrus aroma, not overwhelming but slightly astringent. Mouthfeel is lighter, carbonation plenty ample overall, maybe overdone. Granular senses, pithy with black pepper and asociated spices. Malt is fairly ordinary in impression. Despite the American aroma hops, the beer remains well-balanced and tight. Finishes with a bit of tar resin and some exaggerated fizziness in the aftertaste. Drinkable, but a bit unremarkable, not sure why Coniston needs an entry like this, but its an interesting idea.",2005-06-11,22363,XB Bluebird Bitter

3.35,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,"Amber beer with golden highlights, topped by a fine but foamy head. Midly orange citrus in the nose blends well with the very light touch of phenols that have always bothered me about this beer. Hints of toast and caramel. Toasty in the mouth, but overall quite light on the malt flavor and fullness of the body. Carbonation is way too fierce, same as with the original. Orangey citrus hop flavor is restrained.

That's roughly the smell I get from various Rogue, Dogfish Head and Stone beers. Piercing notes of iron and lemon with the sticky red resins one associates with the ""other"" herb. The rusty brass color and background aromas indicate nice, glazed malt sugars.  On the palate it is balanced. Easy, hardened shells of honey and caramel flavors contain leafy mints and lemon peel notes that rise on the finish. Cottony tannins and tangy acidity don't quite fill in a gap on the mid-palate. Where's the obnoxious malty sweetness and head-spinning alcohol? Oh yeah, it's a hybrid. This beer's English chromosomes require it to be very drinkable.",2005-03-03,22363,XB Bluebird Bitter

Not much malt to speak of.  Palate: Light-medium bodied; refreshing; low-medium carbonation (tight bubbles); the peach-apricot really comes through on the palate. Nice acidity (vaguely citrus). Golden malt breaks through near the finish. Malt bill is pretty straight-forward, with the hops and yeast providing aroma and flavor. Heather-floral hop aftertaste.

3.27,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.25,3.25,"A 500ml bottle with a BB of June 2014. Acquired a while back from an off-licence. Described as a light, golden ale and named after the Pitchfork rebellion at the end of the English civil war. Poured into a tulip pint glass. Bottle conditioned. A hazy golden-amber hue with plenty of floating sediment and good carbonation. Yields a large head of creamy white foam with decent retention; this slowly reduces to a surface layer. Lovely lacing. Aroma of earthy yeast with hints of grainy malt, fruity esters, mild grass/hay and subtle stewed leaves. OK but tired. Tastes of light malt with a yeasty character and a dry finish. Notes of yeast esters, mild grain, grass/hay, subtle stewed leaves, a twinge of cardboard and faint earthiness. A delicate hint of green apples lurks in the background, followed by a light bitterness upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth, tingly and dry, with spritzy carbonation and decent body. Little bit too fizzy. Somewhat astringent, accompanied by an aftertaste of earthy yeast, husks and acrid stewed leaves. Not brilliant, though I reckon the age of the bottle might have something to do with it. Looks alright, while the aroma and flavour are overly yeasty and otherwise quite bland. Mouthfeel is OK but a shade overcarbonated. Possible yeast overdevelopment or cell death giving some off-notes to the character. Nothing special but might be worth sampling again if I have the chance. No need to hunt it down.",2014-06-23,4059,Pitchfork Rebellious Bitter

It poured with a finger high foamy white head that has excellent retention properties and consistently left a thin head covering the surface. S: There are aromas of floral hops along with some citrus in the nose. T: A moderately strong amount of bitterness stands out in the overall taste along with subtle notes of fruity yeast and hints of sweetness. M: It feels light- to medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation. The finish leaves your mouth with a hint of dryness. O: This beer is very sessionable and goes down quite easily; I would have no problem drinking several of these in a sitting.

There's a great floral hop character to the nose, bordering on herbal. Malt is dry, subdued, a bit crackery. It's somewhat mineral, especially when it warms, and there's faint green apple fruitiness. Very flavorful, hop-forward and quite bitter. Hop flavors take on a more earthy and herbal quality on the tongue. The malt foundation is bready and dry, quite crisp. There's a mineral backbone that seems to enhance the dryness, adding a bit of astringency that doesn't go too far. It's a light bodied beer, but not as thin as some bitters can be - there's just enough heft. Apple-like fruitiness appears mid-palate, but the strong bitterness in the finish quickly washes it away. Bitterness could stand to be dialed down a bit, I feel like it covers up some of the complexity.

Smells of light and crisp pale malts with mild amounts of earthy and slightly grassy hops. Also present are very small amounts of indistinct medium fruits. Tastes good. Smooth pale malt flavors kick things off and are joined quickly by hints of breadiness. Midway through the sip the flavor profile dries out a bit with the addition of light citrus and earthy hops. The hops carry through to a moderately bitter ending. Mouthfeel is good. It's got a nice thickness with soft carbonation. Drinkability is very good. I finished my glass quickly and could easily have a few more. Overall there wasn't much about this beer that stood out but it was absurdly easy to drink.

All that time wasting beer space on Boddingtons, the only half real English bitter you can find with any regularity, could have been spent searching out this gem of a beer. From a 1pt 9fl oz bottle with no freshness dating. This pours a thick creamy head, but it doesn't need a damn widget to do so. The head domes over the beer creating a fluffy cloud pocked by bubbles. Golden orange beer sits protected and happy underneath Lacing is everywhere sticking like wheat paste to some damn hippie's reggae show flyer. Golden orange beer sits protected and happy underneath The smell of this is pure English pub, slightly musty from the mild hops, somewhat biscuity from the malt and with just a touch of citrus to give lift and dimension. The flavors are off the charts, in a non-extreme beer sort of way. This is never going to crush ones palate. Instead it refreshes and livens with the drying butter cracker malt and lingering orange flesh and lemongrass flavors. This is wildly complex but is not something that is going to blow your mind, unless you pay close attention. The earthy, mushroom-y character here is incredibly pleasing and plays nicely into is mild bitterness. I love the carbonated yet creamy mouthfeel of English bitters, especially when you can get it without the cheating widget. I don't need my beer to taste like it came from a cask, unless it actually does. This is like a mousse, a delicious bitter mousse, substantial but airy, never feeling heavy on the palate. At 4.30% this is something I can drink a lot of. The flavors are spot on for the style, and the style is one of my favorites. Hot, cold, wet, dry it really does not matter, I'd happily drink this anytime of the year and at 5.99 a bottle I think it is reasonable, I've paid a lot more for bottles and been much less satisfied.

The head was well formed and stayed throughout the drink. Yeast and hops made up the aroma, what else should there be in an English Bitter?

Excellent head retention for the entire session and there is plenty of lacing.  The smell is a nice mix of caramel malt and some fruity notes. Overall, the nose is telling me that this one is going to be on the sweet side with not much of a hop presence. Being an English Bitter, I hope that's what it turns out to be. The taste turns out as I hoped. Some sweetish tones kick things off followed closely by a nice fresh fruity flavour that soon dominates. The hops are there, of course, but assuming that they're the Goldings, they give this Bitter just a wee touch of citrus just before and through the finish and add the necessary amount of ""bitterness"" to balance the malt. Well done, me thinks, as I'm finding this 4.3%abv example of the style *very* easy to drink and it's not just because it's low in alcohol; this is a tasty son of a gun and that will stand, for me, on its own. I have no clue as to the age of this bottle, other than I notice some haziness with the second pour and some....floaties. Ok. Another brew from the UK that, obviously, isn't in its peak condition and I guess I'm getting used to that by now.

Smell: A little grape-y (not grapefruit), understated (typical of the style). Taste: A beautiful light and freshing sweetness up front, and finishes sweet still but with a hint of a dry-hoppiness.  Mouthfeel: Incredibly balanced. Neither the maltiness, which tends towards fruity rather than bready, nor the hops dominate this beer: it's simply a wonderful marriage of very good raw ingredients. Drinkabily: High. This is the first time I had this beer, and sometimes my prejudice (for and against) English bitters compels me to usually rate their beers ""quaint"" and unremarkable. However, this one does stick out for me. Maybe it's been a while since I've sampled many beers of the style, but this one was either quite fresh, or just beautifully made. Or both!

Gold medal for the Best Bitter category at the 1998 GBBF~~ But I reckon that's the cask-conditioned version, which is truly sensational when on form. This bottle-conditioned interpretation comes in a 500ml brown bottle. BB FEB 07, served cool in a straight imperial-pint glass. A: pours a dark orangey golden hue, coming with a rocky, thick and foamy beer head, sustaining very well and gradually leaving tight lacing; gentle and constant carbonation. S: mildly honeyish, citrussy, and a little earthy hop aroma (like Fuggles+Challenger, who knows?) dominates, along with a mildly sour and musty note of yeasts and a bittering hoppyness, while a very light grainy theme of pale malts plays the second fiddle and complements the hoppyness pretty well.  T: refreshing, slightly sharp, citrus hops flow onto the palate, simultaneously a profound current of piney bitterness quickly builds up and expands into the four corners of the palate, leaving a slightly musty, leafy yeastiness and a nutty-malty flavour lingering in the long aftertaste. Superbly dry and bitter finish, like it's dry-hopped. M&amp;D: besides the fine carbonation, the phenomenal bitterness helps result in a 3D and lively palate throughout. This is a medium-bodied, reasonably flavoursome, and really really bitter Bitter.

When I stopped pouring, my pint glass only had about a half-inch of liquid in the bottom; the rest was foam. I was very careful on subsequent pourings, but the head still rose up big. As this huge mass of bubbles dissipated, it was frothy and rocky, settling very slowly. The gigantic head left behind some nice lace, sometimes in thick chunks. Smell: Light sweet malt and wild grasses combined with light hops and spicy yeast. Hints of wild flowers, light fruits, such as grapes and apples, and sulpher. Overall, a light, fresh aroma. Mouthfeel: Light-bodied and crisp. Smooth, but firm, with a light carbonation that developed in the back of the mouth. Taste:  Decanted - Grasses and wild flowers kicked in right from the start. There was only a hint of sweet and biscuit malt present. That wild, grassy and floral flavor developed into a floral hops bitterness. This lingered into the finish where hints of sweetness rose up again. Just a bit of crisp, clean fruitiness showed up in the aftertaste along with the bitterness. With Yeast - The flavors rounded out and became fuller with the yeast added. It had less of an edge and the almost lager-like characteristics that it had decanted really subsided. Still the same beer (not overly malty with a firm bitterness), but just ""broader"" tasting. A dry, crisp, clean, and refreshing bitter. Almost lager-like when decanted.",2005-11-28,4059,Pitchfork Rebellious Bitter
3.53,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"16.9 oz brown bottle with a very informative label.  The beer pours a very hazy straw/gold with a massive dense head. There is lots of good sticky lacing.  The nose is grassy with some spice. Almost a metallic smell in the background.  The taste is pleasant. It is slightly bitter with an almost woody characteristic. A bit if apple emerges as well. Halfway through, I noticed that some citrus/grapefruit pushes itself forward. I can easily see why this beer reminds some folks of tonic water. Very highly carbonated and I think that distracts a bit from the mouthfeel. Drinkabity is fine, but it is not quite a session beer for me.  My first beer from this brewery, I would search out more and would love to try it a the source.",2005-10-31,4059,Pitchfork Rebellious Bitter

It has a pale malt scent along with a slightly dry, yet fruity English yeast aroma. It's bitter with noble hops; quite nice. The taste is average. It has a very bitter hop flavor that is way over the top. It has a light pale malt flavor, but there is no real balance here. It has a powerful grapefruit aftertaste. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is an average bitter. It's way too over the top for me. I'm not a huge fan of citrus hops.

3.62,5.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,"Another English ale that pours with a good amount of carbonation (probably because it bottle-conditioned.) This bitter pours with a beautifully rocky head that slowly falls leaving thick lacing. There's just a little bit of a saltine cracker aroma. A fairly full-bodied bitter with a straightforward maltiness (not complex) and hearty bitter finish. Nothing terribly complex here, just a very refreshing bitter ale. Perhaps a bit too clean for the style, but a good quencher, and certainly bitter enough. The bottle mentions adding the yeast to the bottle for ""a fuller flavour"", which I'd recommend, as doing so seemed to bring out a delicate fruitiness in this beer. I liked this beer but it seemed to be overcarbonated. I can only imagine what it would be like on cask.",2005-08-12,4059,Pitchfork Rebellious Bitter

Lively carbonation going on in the glass. Excellent head retention and sheets and chains of lace coat the glass. The final pour, with the yeast swirled in, produces a murky orange brown body with some ""floaties"" in suspension. Aroma: Fruity, spicy, and floral hop notes with toasty pale malt bready aromas in the background. Mouthfeel: Light medium body, with appropriate medium carbonation. Taste: Bitter floral hops balance well with pale malt sweetness. Pears and apple skins offer up a delicate fruity component. Quite bitter hops finish and long aftertaste. Drinkability: Wow! This is probably the best English Bitter I've sampled. I'm looking forward to picking up some more of these.

Light brown sugar aroma with an appetizing hop aroma, muted and bark-like, but nice. Light body but fairly generous carbonation. Interesting beer, emphasizes hops but distinctly in an English style, tight and floral, verging on charred. Pretty good balance but hop skewed. Notable in that its almost a stand out in taking a classic Bitter to its extreme, low in alcohol and sharp and a nice change of pace in light of the numerous American Ales that cross my path.

Smell: Wet grass, lemon, limes and a feint damp wet horse blanket odor that lends a dank atmosphere to the neck of my Pint glass. Soggy floral aromas that seem off at times. Taste: Lemongrass start that has a light toasted malt feel. Middle develops a funky wet hop character, grungy ending which builds and then develops a very astringent bitter trait. Lingering bitter aftertaste that is not appealing at times. Mouthfeel: Thin, like a Schweppes Tonic Water laced with a hint of lemon and lime. Weak feel throughout. Definitely lacking in this area..feeble even. Drinkability: Off-putting to say the least, not that hard to drink but too thin to retain interest, and the astringent bitterness is not good in the long term either. Overall: What the heck have these guys bottled??.it isnt the Pitchfork I recall from my heady Cask Ale drinking days in the UK.

The nose was sltigthly caramel sweet with a toasted character and a really nice english hop, pretty much what I would expect of a bitter. The flavor was very nice, mellow caramel and toasted grains moved to a really smooth yet crisp hop that lingered nicely on my tongue. There was a slight metallic aftertaste that detracted a bit. The beer was smooth and an awesome moderate feel. This beer was a very nice one to start the evening with. Served at just the perfect temperature.

The creamy, ivory colored head features gently popping bubbles on its upper surface and leaves a great deal of lace from the top edge of the glass downwards. There's something about the appearance of the beer, the head, and the combination of the two that strikes me as immensely appealing. The nose is dominated by floral-herbal-citric hops, classic for an English pale ale or bitter. Some lightly toasted grain peeks through as well. Upon tasting... this is good beer. It may not have an abundance of flavor or a truly bracing bitterness, but it's more than adequate.  Although there's little actual flavor contribution from the pale malt, it's obvious that there's enough on hand to provide ballast and balance. The hops are floral, herbal and fruity, in descending order. Actually, fruity might be a stretch. As the beer warms, the hops definitely gain confidence. Pitchfork isn't quite a pitchfork to the tongue, but the Bitter portion of the name is more than apt. Pitchfork Rebellious Bitter is pretty good beer. If you allow it to warm a bit (spend the time appreciating the lace), the hops find their stride and makes this a highly drinkable, incredibly sessionable English ale.",2004-12-30,4059,Pitchfork Rebellious Bitter

Theres a tad of sweetness in there as well. Mouthfeel  This is the beers weak point, IMO. This ale is flat, flat, flat. It does absolutely nothing for the tongue, which is a shame.

Sadly this is now the only beer Sam Smith’s brewery brings out in cask form, everything else is keg or bottle, not cask. Clear amber body with a creamy head of bubbles which are off-white in colour and produce some good thick lacing as I down the liquid it covers. The nose is a complex mix of wood notes, autumn leaves, caramel and a fresh loaf of bread. The taste is equally as complex: malts just about lead the way with a good hop contingent coming up fast behind, well balanced and easy to drink. Semi-sweet from the caramel like molasses in the malts, but with an undertone of hop bitterness which asserts itself half way through each gulp (this isn’t a sipping beer, it’s a gulper).

3.58,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,"Having had this beer on cask for many many times at Samuel Smith's houses throughout London (it surprises me just how many very old pubs have been taken over~~), this is the first time I truly feel that I should record what I've tasted. For the pint consumed at the Angel (nr. St. Giles Church and Tottenham Court tube station) recently, was the best I've had in addition to the perfect pouring by the cool but skilful barman there. A: dispensed with a sparkler (presumably), it comes in a bright and clear, reddish-amber hue; a tight and creamy beige beer head sits on top and refuses to budge throughout the drink. S: a sour-sweet woody hint buttresses a slightly resinous and dried grassy hops, but very smooth; a fruity overtone of plums asserts itself in the back, rather understated, but dovetails the fore-note just fine. T: a natural woody, sour-sweet edge and refreshing but softly plummy+apple-ish fruity flavour accompany a very creamy-textured malty entry, complementing each other just beautifully; very faint bitterness struggles to pierce through the impressive silky maltiness, rendering a clean aftertaste and slightly drish hint from both wooden casks (used to age this beer) and hops. M&amp;D: the mouthfeel is great, silky smooth, perfectly controlled carbonation and medium-bodied, this really is a quaffable traditional ale--maybe a cross b/w bitter and pale ale? For one, I'd recommend drinking this classic ale at this quality little gem, the Angel, for full enjoyment (if one's in central London rather than Doncaster, that is).  Warning: the same beer could be very bland when served on tap, over-chilled, or dispensed carelessly, in another Samuel Smith's pub with poor bar-training and cellarmanship, though.",2006-06-01,4074,Old Brewery Bitter

The atmosphere in which this beer was consumed may have skewed my review, but here goes: Appearance: Clear brown and almost still. This bitter is a hand pumped cask ale, and thus there was very little carbonation present. Very mellow and pleasing to the eye. Smell: Hoppy aroma, and I do mean bursting with. I've never been good at identifying the different varieties of hops, but one whiff of this beer, and you know they're there (this after all a bitter). Taste:Hoppy, warm and slightly carbonated; this beer is only slightly bitter due to the hops but it is balanced nicely with a little bit of sweetness owing to a malty character. Drinkability: I was in heaven getting Samuel Smith on tap. A truly amazing experience. This beer goes down smooth, and with the relatively low alcohol content of 4.% abv, you could drink these all night (speaking from experience). I think I paid 2 pounds 50 pence per pint (roughly $3.75), and it was worth every cent. If you find yourself in London anytime soon, check out Cittie of Yorke.",2003-01-30,4074,Old Brewery Bitter
4.07,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,"Samuel Smiths Old Brewery Bitter (OBB) divides opinions in the UK, even amongst CAMRA members and experienced beer drinkers. What needs to be understood is that it is predominantly a Malt based beer, and not really like your run-of-the-mill English session Bitters.  Also, it is from Yorkshires oldest Brewery, it is brewed from the Breweries own well water, has NO adjuncts, does not benefit from any Brewery aids whatsoever, utilises the Yorkshire Squares (made from Slate) system of fermentation, and when distributed to nearly all of its Pubs in Cask Conditioned format, it is supplied in Wooden Casks, YES Wooden!!- NOT Steel, or Aluminum, but- Wood. One of only a handful of UK Brewers left that still employ a Cooper.  Sadly, after the demise of Tadcaster Bitter and Museum Ale :-((, this is now the only Cask-Conditioned beer that Sams make. Such a Tragic Shame. So with the above in mind, you will never find a Handpulled Sams OBB with a decent head, whilst Wooden Casks will keep the beer in good condition, high carbonation levels are rarely experienced in this format. In the North of England where Swan-Necks, or Sparklers, are used for dispense you may get something resembling a head. As such, the head tends to dissipate quickly to a thin covering. Has a light brown, typical English Bitter color, that has a higher than average strength at 4% ABV. Malt is prevalent in the initial tastes, and to a certain extent dominates the beer. However, when on form, it has a fruitiness to die for, with a superb hoppy finish that really makes this beer. It often has a long lingering bitter, fruity finish. Mouthfeel is average, which again is perfectly acceptable for this beer  bear in mind people in the UK will often drink a Gallon of this beer in one night. It is a true Session Beer. Ironic I know, but dont expect it to be Bitter!. This is a very misunderstood beer, rarely appreciated  but I dearly love it, and in the North of England, in Sams Houses you will be hard pressed to beat it for value. Also, Sams Pubs themselves take some beating. Last Tasted at the Historic Samuel Smiths Inn, the White Horse, or Nellies, in Beverley, North Yorkshire. www.nellies.co.uk Go on - have a look, and see what you are missing.

4.82,4.0,4.5,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Presentation: Presented in a straight sided Pint Glass at d.b.a. on a rather chilly and drizzly dark November night during a recent week long stay in NYC. Straight out of the Cask and dispensed through one of the Beer Engines at the end of the bar. Enjoyed a Pint of this with my fellow BA and Ex-Pat Sir Alex the Imbiber. Appearance: Luscious golden body, clear with some residual milky conditioning, a good sign that, took some time to settle but this must have helped it form a nice looking tightly compacted white head when it did, which in turn must have contributed to its great staying power. Impressive soft carbonation and a fine presentation.  Nose: High strength aroma for a Cask Ale. Lots of fruity odors mixed in with a laid back but juicy hop character, cut grass and a very floral dimension, all of which is nicely balanced by some grassy tones and light hints of toasted malts. Taste: As good as it gets; more lightly toasted bready malts merge with a supreme balance with an accent on grassy hops and a classic English Bitterness. Immense clarity of vision and a very refreshing crisp and clean feel. Bloody Hell this is a great brew.  Mouthfeel: The conditioning in the HopHead on the day I had the beer was very impressive. Obviously my pet bitch that US Bars so often mis-use or never use spiles properly is not the case at d.b.a. The talcum soft mouth feel mixed perfectly with the hoppy tang and fruity aspects of this one. Quite Simply  Perfect. Drinkability: You what?!?! A straight 5. And its only 3.8%!!! Easily one of the most quaffable English Ales that I have had in New York. I am sure it is partly down to the fact that this was served reet on form and at the epoch of its cask prime, but a majority of the quaffability is down to its supreme balance.  Overall: A long overdue Beer Review that I promised my good friend Imbiber and the BeeryMatts that I would add, even though I dont usually add them for Beers drunk in Bars, it took a while, but I make no excuse for making an exception in this case. This truly was and is a really great Working Class English Session Bitter with a killer hoppy twist.

4.3,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,"I always went for a pint of this beer whenever I got a chance to visit the Evening Star pub in Brighton. Sort of got used to it when living down south. But it was not until moving to London have I really started to miss it... Happy to see it on draught at my local Wetherspoon's pub in East End London recently, praying that it'd be fresh and nice... A: it pours a pale straw colour, with extremely tiny, fine bubbles in the liquid, and a very thin, white beerhead lasting well and leaving tight lacing around the glass. S: white grapefruit-peel dominates the nose along with a semi-sweet, juicy fruity note, against a mild malty aroma. Overall the hop aroma is very assertive but not aggressive. T&amp;M: upfront is a mouthful of juicy, softly-citric hops (Cascade?), with very soft palate of malts underneath; reasonably lingering aftertaste of fruity hops and a hint of wild, high-mountain honey and pollen-like floral flavour on the tongue. Towards the end the hops gradually overwhelm the mouth, resulting in a kind of crisp bitterness b/w the teeth and tongue, arousing more and more thirst~~ D: overall it's a thin-bodied, balanced hoppy ale with almost full flavour; extremely enjoyable!",2005-08-14,14297,HopHead

The brew was pulled to a darker golden yellow color with a nice fluffy white head that had quite good retention and left chunks of lace at the top of the glass and a fair amount rings through out the rest of the brew. The first thing that I noticed about the aroma was hops, pleasant grass note aroma. Also can pick up the malt, gives it a somewhat sweet scent that seems to balance out the beer quite well. The taste was good, nothing spectacular but had a pronounced bitterness to it that was not as enjoyable as I was expecting. Also had a nice malt backbone that seemed to tie everything together. Over this is a pretty good brew, I would have this one again in the future but will not be one that I go out of my way to get.",2005-05-08,14297,HopHead

This English Bitter poured a clear, dark golden color with white, sudsy foam that persisted and clung to the glass. The smell was nicely fruity and floral hops. A very nice, strong aroma. The taste was hoppy, floral and bitter with a light malt sweetness to balance. The mouthfeel was smooth and hoppy with medium-light body and low carbonation. The hoppiness lingered nicely in the aftertaste. This was a very good bitter, and would make an excellent session beer.",2004-12-07,14297,HopHead

3.85,4.25,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.75,"On tap at brewery: The glass holds a baked straw liquid, one that looks like it should be clear with its light color, but actually has a uniform haze that is near opaque. The pour does not allow me to tell the ease of head production, but the frothy white ring with medium bubbles trapped within it lasts and there is some early lacing. Nose took some time to open, and even then is a tad light. Crackery malts and a light lemon-leaning citrus lean with a dry-grass to hay-like accent. Taste starts with the expected clean malt, which has a bit more dry bread to it than expected. A lively carbonation, but of micro-bubbbles that keep it from being too aggressive. Hay and grain husk strewn across the ground gets a turn towards a more herbal bitterness with some dry cut grass. Definitely a dry finish, with a light numbness from the carbonation. A nice, very dry light beer that I wouldn’t be surprised has a fair to low IBU, but one that has those bitter units all coming to bear.

The aroma is of light citric hops and a biscuity malt backing. The taste is a lot more balanced then the nose, but follows the same profile. Fairly low carbonation, near flat. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, but the low carbonation gives the impression of a more watery body.

Lemon is there, but it is not as powerful as more bitter citrus flavors, and everything takes a back seat the resinous pine flavors. The malt backbone adds a little bit of grain, but it is subdued. Light body, highly carbonated.  After working my way through and Adam from the wood and needing to stay upright for many more hours, I decided to give Little Dog a taste.

I've seen it listed at both 3.5% and 4.0% abv. A: Almost clear, a light straw/golden. Not much carbonation, what little is there rises sleepily, crawling up the contours of the glass. Very nice head, a finger+ of frothy white suds with sturdy clinging lace in dappled patterns and broken ribbons. S: Dry crusty bread and raw grassy/spicy hops. Hay/straw, notably musty. Moments of malty wort and sweeter honey, biscuits.  T: Remarkably robust flavor, some sticky pine and a pithy/zesty citrus rind. Sturdy malty backbone, but a draping bitterness (that approaches a threshold it never quite crosses) provides plenty of depth. Fluttering fruitiness and sprinkles of spice, this one may be a bit simpler than than bigger beer from which it was 'born', but not by much... M: Surprising medium feel (again, one could easily be fooled into believing this to be a much heartier APA, for instance). Good carbonation and refreshing crispness, despite lacking some in the appearance. Minor demerits for some gumminess and tongue stickiness in the finish, but so be it. O: So damn drinkable! Truly a sessionable beer, low alcohol and bold flavors (and cheap draft price, too!) would keep me returning to this again and again. As a 'small beer', this may not be to everyone's liking, but I'm fascinated by it and will continue to enjoy it as long as Alan and crew keep brewing Fred, Doggie Claws, Adam, etc.",2011-07-14,61950,Little Dog

It smells of white cracker grain, lemon, and grassy hops. The taste is quite in line with the nose - crisp grainy malt, zippy lemon, and earthy, grassy hops. The carbonation is moderate, the body light, but nowhere near thin, and nicely smooth. It finishes hoppy and edgy. Seems more like a veritable Continental pils, and a good one at that.

Soft butterscotch yeast in the begining, and it seems to stick throughout the journey. Low gravity toffee, faint hops, esters. Soft in the mouth, very easy to knock back.

3.42,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,"Appearance: Pretty cloudy burnt caramel color with a small 1/4"" head of tan bubbles that faded within about 30 seconds.  Aroma: Lots of sweet fruity british hops accenting the toasty notes of the British malts. This is a very aromatic beer, but I would say that the hops are in charge of the aroma overall. As the beer warms, the caramel sweetness is becoming more apparent. Taste: The toasty sweet British malts are a huge player in the flavor, but the hops are no slouch. There seems to be a reversal of roles here as I believe that the malt is the dominant player in the flavor. There are some minerals that are obvious in the flavor as mouthfeel...leaving a chalky feeling to linger on the back of the throat. There is a bit of oxidation in this beer as well, so this may be why the hops are more muted in the flavor. Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. I am nort a huge fan of the British styles for the most part, and this beer is no exception. I like a beer with lighter water, and this one sits on my palate pretty heavy.

3.97,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Presentation: 500ml brown glass bottle sealed with a black crown cap that has the red lion on it. The old style Strongarm Arm and Hammer label has long gone to be replaced with a rather tame leaping red lion. No strength or freshness date. Appearance: Dark ruby mahogany chestnut body with an off-white cream colored head which has a decent half-life. Below average carbonation yet the overall appearance is of a feisty brew that puts out the looks. Nose: Rich caramel, dark berries, nutty caramel and a light dark chocolate hint. The nose tends to accelerate with freshly brewed and baked odors that bolster the depth of the aromas. Taste &amp; Mouthfeel: Just as I thought it was, malty with NorthEast tones that induce a mild bitterness. Ruby tinged dark fruits, some bonfire toffee and a texture that can be grainy at times. A Mans beer that takes some acclimatization, as a Student boy drinker it took me a while to get to grips with this one. Find the feet here and this is like traveling on an escalator rather than taking the stairs.  Drinkability: You know this one slips down quite neatly, I expected a faded shadow of a once-loved brew and found a rather solid effort that actually reminded me of how good this once was. A surprisingly lovable brew. Overall: Wow!!! This one brings back many memories. Before I even cracked this brew, I knew that my Beer Review would be a lengthy trip down memory lane. The label still says The Lion Brewery and that has changed hands many times, now it is the ownership of Castle Eden, but the the original ""Arm &amp; Hammer"" Strongarm label has long gone. I first sampled this hardy NorthEast brew from Camerons on a regular basis at the Pig &amp; Whistle, Leeds City Centre in the 1987 whilst I was an Engineering UnderGraduate at the (real) University of Leeds. At that time the pub was situated in the depths of the Merrion Centre, owned and operated by Camerons, and sold both the Strongarm (4.0%) and Strongarm Premium (4.5%) on Cask, and I frequently enjoyed them both along with the regular Lion Bitter. This latest bottle of Strongarm (from neighbors and one time competitors Castle Eden) seems very much tilted towards the original Strongarm from what I can tell and recall. I also had the greatest pleasure to visit the Camerons Lion Brewery many, many years ago on a local Branch CAMRA trip, including lunch in the Board Room  oh heck, those were the days!! Afterwards we hit up the local Camerons pub just around the corner from the Brewery (the Stanton Arms is now the Brewery Visitors Centre); it wasnt uncommon to get a massive cone-shaped Ice-Cream head on a pint of Strongarm in those days.even as a Yorkshireman used to thick heads I laughed at the monstrous Mount Everest pyramid that arrived on my Pint when I took possession of it and jokingly asked if I would get a flake and a wafer with it..to which the 250lb Landlords quick riposte was Eeeaatsszzz foook-yeeen Stronn arm Man, I think he was going to beat me up then kill me for disrespect, but he had another Customer to serve and he wanted Walkers Cheese &amp; Onion Crisps too. Ah, happy memories of the North East, I wonder if they still hang Monkeys as French Spies!?! Eeeaatsszzz foook-yeeen Stronn arm Man",2006-09-01,2933,Camerons Strongarm
3.7,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,"Purchased at New World Beverage in NYC. 500 ml. bottle. Pours a hazy brown with an off-white two-fingered head that fades to a collar of foam on the brew. Some lacing evident though it is short-lived. Clear at first but bottles are heavily sedimented so a careful pour is in order for a clearer brew. Aroma is malty. Ripe apples and molasses in the nose, no hops evident. Taste is mildly bitter. Refreshing. Some fruity notes but overwhelmingly hoppy with a short spicy hop finish. Must be UK hops as no citrus evident. Mouthfeel was light almost watery. This is a drinkable brew. Might be a nice session ale were it not for the higher ABV.",2006-08-19,2933,Camerons Strongarm
3.45,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,"Poured a deep chestnut color with modest off-white head. Smell is mainly of fruity malt with no hop character noted. Taste is also mainly malty with a bit too sweet fruity taste. Finishes with more sweetness and this sweetness begins to get a bit tiring. With no hop presence to balance the malt this is a very one-dimensional beer. Drinkable, but nothing great.",2006-07-29,2933,Camerons Strongarm

Add to this a lovley deep amber and a constant stream of bubbling, and the best lacing I'v seen on any English Pale ale. Smell- a decent mix of pale and amber malts with some undescribable bitterness at the end. Different, put not good for a pale ale. Taste- Starts out with a good mix of English hop bitterness and the amber and plae mlats that quickly change to a more malt character in the back of the tongue. The finish is a slightly rye like bitterness in the back of the throat. Mouthfeel- A little dry, but mostly bready and lightly sweetened. Has a good lingering, bittered malt flavor.",2006-06-27,2933,Camerons Strongarm
3.63,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,"Pours a very dark red/brown with a thick one inch head that settles to a thin ring and leaves a tattered bit of lacing. Smell; lots of caramel malts, a bit spicy and has a kind of smokey oak barrel quality. Taste; that smokiness follows over in the taste, as well as a strong caramel maltiness. There's some nutty flavors and a touch of a spicy hop bitterness in the finish. The flavors definitely get better, and more pronounced as this warms. Reminds me of a bitter I had while in a pub in Gibraltar that I've long since forgotten the name of. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side for me, but the drinkablility is good.",2006-03-04,2933,Camerons Strongarm
3.15,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,"Appearance: Slightly murky reddish-brown in color, with a small off-white head, which retains well. The lacing is fairly thick, and rings the glass nicely. Aroma: Profound aroma of malt and dark caramel, a decent hop presence, and a slight spice note. Taste: Opens with a burnt caramel note, which defines the taste from start to finish. Towards the end of the taste, an astringent bitter note appears. Finishes with mild, but persistent herbal and medicinal hop bitterness. Mouth feel: A bit light, soft on the palate. Drinkability/notes: An average example of the style, not bad, but there are much better bitters that can be had.

3.31,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,"Tasted this beer by a pint recently at my local Wetherspoon's pub in East End London. Appearance: it pours a clear, dark-ruby to caramel colour, a thin beerhead with reasonable retention, with low-medium carbonation and at just about right temp. Aroma: the nose has brown-sugar and crystal/dark malts as the most noticeable elements, with residual, lightly floral hops at the back. Nothing too special or exciting. Taste: on the palate it's mainly lightly-caramelised-sugary, plus lightly sour, dark-malts and toffeeish flavour--the malts are so chewy that they actually surround the mouth with full flavour... At the back there comes a soft mouthfeel of nutty and moderate bitterness, combined with floral hoppyness towards the finish. The aftertaste has a bit sour taste of malts and some unwelcomed watery mouthfeel, thus bringing down the overall score of taste. Mouthfeel &amp; Drinkability: the mouthfeel overall is quite smooth and the body is in my opinion balanced, but this beer lacks somewhat exceptional elements to make it stand out as a really tasty pale ale or bitter. A very easy-drinking malty ale, but it can be boring after the first pint.",2005-08-07,2933,Camerons Strongarm

A red, warm pour produces a pancake top and decadent, malty aromas that outline masses of roasted nuts and vanilla. Exotic elements of Cuban rum, cocoa and roasted banana peels float dreamily just underneath that. On the palate it is chewy and fizzy, and possesses every chuggable facet of &amp;lt;5% ABV. Bronzed, burnt sugars and assertive, tannic bitterness, increasing on the finish, mold pretty fruits of apples, maraschino cherries and cola. It finishes dry and clean. Attention dabblers: you may want to follow this beer with another. Don't limit yourself to one bottle, and for Pete's sake don't drink it cold! A find.

Medium body, moderate carbonation. Taste of caramel malt comes in noticably as do some fruit flavors, apple being the most noticable. Some buttery flavors come in as well, I guess this is what diacetly tastes like. Finishes with almost no aftertaste. Plenty easy drinking, if not plenty interesting.

Malty aroma, slightly musty and dusty but with a caramel and slight butter undertone. Lightish body but plenty of carbonation. Burnt caramelized sugar taste, creme brulee, bittering from English style hops early but matched by Heath bar toffee and a touch of wild honey. Thins a little mid mouth and closes on the light side, without nearly as much impact. Overall, I'd say this is a nice enough brew, good drinkability but the close is a little weak, making a little too much of a switch for me.",2005-01-09,2933,Camerons Strongarm

The brew had a hazy amber color with a nice off white head that broke down very slowly and left some lacing. The aroma of this brew was of caramel and butterscotch malt. The taste does along with the aroma but you get a strong apple cider flavored finish. It took me a while to actually figure out what I was experiencing. A very different tasting brew! The flavor, even though different seemed to be weak or was missing something. Over all it was a nice brew and was very happy I got the chance to try it on cask.

The retention is incredible...I'm tempted to give a '5' on appearance due to the fact that the head stayed with this one right up to the last drop...impressive. With the obviously sticky head, it left a gorgeous lacing on the glass as it was consumed. Smell: Weaker than expected aroma given the gorgeous appearance. In my opinion, the weakest point of a well-made beer. Given that, it smells great..can pick up some slight fruits as well as some bready malt aromas as well. Taste: Deliciously smooth, bready taste, with obvious caramel malt flavor and mild hop presence as well. Great representation of the ""ale"" taste with an English style kick. yummy. Mouthfeel: Smooth, crisp mouthfeel. Medium-bodied and refreshing.. Bready &amp; creamy going down.. My only major complaint is that I wish the ABV would be a touch higher...in my opinion, 4% is a little mild given the characteristics of this brew. Drinkability: Extremely drinkable. Overall, I was happily impressed with this offering, as I'd never tried anything from this brewer. For $3/pint, the price isn't bad and it was definitely worth the money to try it.

Hops are present, and seem to be fruity pear and McIntosh apple.  Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, with appropriate carbonation. Smooth and creamy, but too much so. Taste is bigtime malty, like the nose. Very English in character, with a hint of mineral water to liven all the malts. Plenty of dark fruits, soaked in rum and molasses. A doppelbock character, minus the ethanol, is what you have here. Smooth and malty, with an ideal backdrop of British hops.  Very lovely English ale, but not very pale in color or character.

Not for me. This ale, to me, has a similar mouthfeel. Wet, bland, thin, boring. Tastes okay once I get past the lack of mouthfeel. It is kind of like a bitter hop in water type of flavor. I gues maybe a bit of pine here. It has a thin finish with a burst of bitter hop, and leaves some bitter aftertaste. If I saw this next to a mass produced American beer (which I dislike), I would choose the Strongarm.

3.86,4.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,"Strongarm is a beautiful caramel-red with orange highlights; just when I thought that I had seen all possible colors of beer. The head is light toffee brown, is persistent and displays a moonscape surface of fine pits and craters. It's also sticky and eventually deposits better than average lace in near-contiguous sheets. I'm impressed so far.  The nose is of heavily toasted caramel malt, overripe apples and indeterminate spice. I can also appreciate earthy hops and a faint whiff of fruit juice-infused pipe tobacco. The flavor is similar to a few other English ales that I've had recently. It expands on the nose and contains elements of caramel apples, spiced black tea, tobacco and mild cocoa. Hops make more of a statement, both in terms of flavor and bitterness, on the drying finish. The body is strictly medium for the style and I find myself wishing for more mouth-filling creaminess.

A slight biscuit and bread flavor hits in between.Finishes with a smooth slight carob/chocolate with a very minor bitterness. Mouthfeel: This beer is very creamy and smooth.. A nice quality that certainly adds points to this beer. Drinkability: The smoothness of this beer makes it super drinkable. My only complaint on this beer is its flavor profile..

Malts taste harsh, bland, unrefined...reminds me of a ""fiber"" cereal grittyness. This wasn't bad enough to pour out, but I have to say there's not much I like about it.

The beer was pulled straight into a UK sleeve: the Pale and Crystal malts ensured it wasn’t too dark in colour. I thought it reddish amber in body, with a thin covering of white bubbles for a head. The beer was clear and looked inviting, so I attacked it with relish! The aroma came from Golding hops and those aforementioned malts, the malts just about winning in the strength of the smells. The flavours were a mixed bag of caramel, biscuit malts and semi-bitter citrusy hops all blended to produce an easy drinking bitter that doesn’t upset anyone: it also means it doesn’t test your taste buds or excite your tongue too much either. A little more malt content than bittering hops: so the beer leans towards my sweet tooth liking, but only just. Body depth about right for this style and strength of beer: the flavours staying throughout the tasting.

3.88,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,"BB 24 OCT 10, served cool in a straight imperial pint glass. NOTE: The beer is said to be brewed with Pale and Crystal malts, and Goldings aroma hops, hence the major difference with a sister product, Organic Best Bitter, lies in the hop variety (First Gold for the latter). A: pours a bright, dark amber hue with great clarity and very restrained carbonation at play, while the off-white frothy head comes thin but lasts well. S: just like a good honest Best Bitter should be, the aroma consists of caramelised sugar, (melting) barley candy, and, just like what it says on the label, lots of Goldings' sweet orangey citrusness. A closely sniff adds to the aroma extra bits of boiled root-veggie and sweet black tea. Simple and nice, a tad too sweet for the balance, though. T: a hop feast, in the Olde English way - the dried hops give the foretaste plenty of chewy/tannic palate not unlike dried, roasted tea leaves plus dried Chinese herbs, but at the same time a much milder caramely taste of malts (than on the nose) is inextricably mixed with the equally much milder orangey hop taste. The flavour shows an integrated whole, with each sip revealing pretty much the same ingredients smoothly bound together. Not particularly bitter in the aftertaste, where the tongue can still pick up residual aroma from the dried tea-leafy hops as well as an almost roast-malt like dry-ish palate. M&amp;D: the texture is very soft with only necessary amount of tiny bubbles to soothe the taste-buds, while the body comes really decent, never thin for its low alc. strength, thanks to (I think) a sound balance achieved b/w malts and hops, and also an assertive level of hop bitterness. All in all, this is to me a thirst-quenching, light-weight ale, not far from what one'd expect from the cask version in a good old pub!",2009-05-09,10597,St. Peter's Best Bitter

Perhaps it said 3.7%. In any case there is a white label on the back that says 4.4%. It poured very thin with large bubbles and a tawny head.

Its clarity is completely uninterrupted less the occasional bubble that drifts about. A very, very attractive looking beer.  The aroma embodies all things British: floral hoppiness, and a biscuity malt bill, a chalky, mineral-rich water profile. The hop bill is surprisingly not dull; it's incredibly floral and harbors notes of green herbs, grasses, citrus, flowers and vegetables. It is mild but plenty manifest. The hops are mild in the mouthfeel too but leave a soft, lasting note of resin on the palate; the flavour sticks with you. Low bitterness and carbonation make this quite smooth and a low(ish) alcohol makes it very sessionable. This kind of beer is a good from the bottle but a dream on cask. Both hops and malts were used in sufficient quantity to impart healthy, hearty, full body; no ingredients were spared. Every sip has plenty of flavour; the malts carry a moderate hint of caramel or butterscotch. The beer's balanced and clean profile holds up even once it warms.  I was pleasantly, somewhat surprisingly impressed with St. Peter's Best Bitter considering the long journey this bottle has endured and the fact that this style doesn't travel well.

Biscuity with enough light hoppy bitterness to make it extremely refreshing. Very well rounded, hitting the entire mouth. Mouth: Nice medium bodied mouthfeel, with low, tight carbonation making it quite creamy. Overall an exceptional English bitter.

S: Peppy and fudge-like.
T: Dry with a pleasant woody rum quality. Initially just nice and taut with no caramel or warming syrup, but it comes through slightly as your tongue gets more saturated in it. No aftertaste at first. Fairly acidic. A touch of white bread in there, and just a hint of citrus. Gets progressively better towards the end of the pint. Nice fluffy mouthfeel.

Didn't make any note on the smell so I assume it was average.  Tastes extremely malty, very earthy and wholesome. Never had anything taste like this without going into the realms of dark, burnt malt flavours like a stout or porter. Extremely moreish though it eventually gets a bit heavy, plus it's a bit too boozy for a session beer. Slight hops in the background provide a bit of fruitiness to balance, though they are very faint in comparison.  Overall a really nice offering from the now owned by Fullers brewery.

Enjoyable, but nothing special. M: Fairly hefty bitter, with good body and moderate, fine carbonation. Very nice. O: This one was above average, but far from great.

3.78,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,"Tasted by a pint at Sir Charles Napier, Brighton. This is the first time that Ive tried the now Chiswick-brewed HSB. 4 A: clear, dark russet brown in colour, coming with an off-white creamy head that leaves tight lacing behind, on top of rather low carbonation. 3.5 S: rich caramel, pear-drops and sour-sweet plums fill the nostrils, added with a touch of palm sugar, but lacking a more assertive hoppy input as before.  4 T: the initial entry of brown malts and caramelised sugar is ensued by the slow manifestation of hops that mix in the flavour very well, leaving a semi-dryish, faintly earthy, and tea-ish aftertaste a light tinge of sour-sweet ripe plums seems to linger and blends well with the tea-leafy hoppiness. Very pleasant in the finish. 4 M&amp;3.5 D: fresh on the texture, full of micro-scopic fizziness, but the body is lighter than what I can remember from my last pint of Hordean-brewed HSB from three years ago. Although this is still a lovely pint, at the price of 2.95 pounds a pint, I wouldnt rush to try a second pint at this pub again * Review of 14/08/2005: Another favourite cask ale of mine when living in Sussex. Happy to see it on draught at the Cross Keys, a Wetherspoon's pub in City, London. 3.5 A: seemingly fresh, it comes in a brownish hue, with a thin, white head and leaving uneven lacing. Looking o.k. 4 S: the aroma is dominated by a sweetish raisiny, dark-malt note, a port wine-like deeply aromatic texture is also present. Overall it's very juicy and mouthwatering. 4.5 T: rich nutty malt flavour dominates the palate with sightly tart, raw-nut flavour; gradually a profoundly dryish yet fruity and vertically-structured bitterness takes over and lingers well towards the finish. The flavour in the aftertaste, a bit like the taste upfront, is reminiscent of peanuts, dark fruits e.g. black prunes... while a soft bed of hops sustains at the back as a balancer with the otherwise fruity and rich malty palate. 4.5 M&amp;4 D: very rounded mouthfeel throughout, good depth of dark malts and refreshingly bitter texture are the winners for this beer. Very very nice bitter indeed, extremely drinkable for me, especially in Autumn.",2007-12-10,3152,HSB (Horndean Special Bitter)
4.32,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,"Judging by the locations of the other raters, I don't believe this fine ale is imported in the US. Having had the opportunity to spend an extended period of time in England, I've drank my fare share of real ale. My British friend, Matt, always brings me a handful of various ales when he comes to visit, which temporarily quenches my insatiable thirst for British Beer. I had one can of HSB left from his last visit so I thought I'd throw it up on BA. Regular 440ml can (no nitro), poured into an imperial pint glass. Deep brown color, with a deliciously thick whitish head. Smell is fruity and full-bodied. Sips deliciously smooth and fruity, with only the slightest trace of carbonation. A delicious malt flavor overtakes your tongue. Smooth and mild, but extremely drinkable. I miss having this available on tap. And come to think of it, I'm pretty sad this is my last can! Sip? This is a beer to take gulpfuls of. It's somewhat understandable why Brits are able to down pint after pint of dark ales after you've had a brew like HSB. It may be dark, but it goes down smooth and keeps you thirsty for more. Easy to quaff, and leaves a satisfying malt aftertaste. I know this to be one of the more popular bitters in England, so I can only hope that it may one day be exported to the US, to satisfy our ever expanding national beer palette.",2007-11-11,3152,HSB (Horndean Special Bitter)

The flavor is dominated by a bland maltiness. There is very little hoppiness even for an English Bitter. Its a very one dimensional taste. The least hoppy of all the cask bitters I tried.

Flavor of sweet, gummy caramel with some chocolate, oats and roasted notes and floral yet heavily spicy and zesty bitterness. Mouthfeel - Sweetness pervades the front but i cut by a full grain middle and an ever increasing bitterness which is truly scrumptious. Drinkability is very high.

Until today.  Thought it was nitrogenated. It's not, but it pours like it is. Huge rocky tan suds on top of a blurry bronze fluid.  Enormously fragrant. Rusty iron, bitter herbs, weathered barn doors, biscuits, apples, buttery dough, toffee, grapes, flowers.  Enters the mouth toasty and nutty. Roasted walnuts. Plenty biscuity too. Buttered English Muffins topped with dry toffee. Apple pie arrives next. Crisp and crusty, glazed with caramel. Migrates to a fuller fruity sensation, but this time of pear. Amazingly enough, there are even traces of vinousness, white and grapey and bright. Dough exists through it all, coupled with wood splinters. Bitterness builds gradually. Begins a bit rusty, turning to florals, then to a grassier sense. UK hopping (Fuggles and EK Goldings?) done exactly right.  Nearly full bodied initially, but it wanes over time.

The aroma has some metallic notes and leans more towards the sweet and malty side rather than the bitter and hoppy. Has a candy like caramel malt sweetness. The taste is full of flavor and the sweetness is dead on. The hops are there but barely noticeable. Nicely blended. This leaves a sweet butter toffee tang on the tongue. I really enjoyed this beer, although it should have been a bit warmer.",2004-05-07,3152,HSB (Horndean Special Bitter)
4.95,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.5,5.0,"The beer pours an orangey earthy brown, topped with a tight beige head. The foam settles into a thick, even mist after a few minutes, keeping a thick collar all the way through. Somewhat chill hazed, with a deep, rich color that suggests considerable depth. Loads of sticky belgian lace forms rings all the way down the glass. The aroma is just outstanding. Biscuity maltiness is supported by a soft, yet present goldings hoppiness. Excellent estery fruit, just enough, with a light woodsy nuttiness and a slight earthiness to the hopping. A touch of grassy fuggles. Hints of apple and pear, adding to the brew's complexity. A bit of caramel aroma to the malt, adding a touch of sweetness. The flavor starts out with strong maltiness. Very biscuity, with a distinct maris otter flavor. Toastiness paves the way for soft floral esters, conveying a distinct pear taste, along with some red apple. The malt takes on some caramel sweetness into the finish, where it meets with a gorgeously balanced goldings hop flavor. Earthy, leafy and floral, with a slight fuggles grassiness, like a newly mown lawn, I'm thanking the fact that this is canned and impenetrable to light. Some nuttiness is present in the finish, reminiscent of walnut and hazelnut. A touch of yeasty breadiness, which carries into the aftertaste along with biscuity caramel malt and goldings goodness. The aftertaste lingers forever, allowing me to languish in the heavenly flavor. Pleasant hop burps. Rather full bodied, the smooth silkiness supported by soft, minute carbonation. I am so glad this beer is available in the US, and I feel pangs of jealousy for those that enjoy this on a regular basis. Canned or not, this will be a staple in my fridge. A most enjoyable pint, easily one of the best bitters I've had, if not the best. I actually feel a little sad when I take a sip, as I want the glass to last forever. This is exactly what I want in a bitter, and I'm determined to track down a cask. Perhaps this is my holy grail? The only thing keeping this beer from a straight 5 review is the fact that I know it's got to be even more amazing cask conditioned. My only complaints are that I'm having a difficult time allowing it to warm, and the only place i know of that sells it is a small store in north jersey. I can't get enough.

4.36,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,5.0,"A slightly hazy chestnut body with deep reddish-copper highlights is topped by a good-sized head of rocky ""vanilla"" foam. The head holds quite well, and it leaves some very nice rings of lace throughout the pint. The nose displays an earthy/mineral (but not quite metallic) and leafy character that seems to come from a combination of both malt and hops; over a decidedly caramelish malt. The medium body is accentuated by a very fine and delicate carbonation that leaves it creamy, soft and smooth in the mouth. There's just enough carbonation to give it a little mouthfeel and bring out the flavors without becoming gassy. Very nice, and perfect for a session beer. The flavor reveals basically what the aroma indicates with a maltiness that's just as equally earthy and dusty as it is caramelish with a touch of mineral, some leafy hops, and a mild woodiness. More complexities arise, however, with a bit more investigation. There's an underlying touch of yeasty, berry-like fruitiness; and a toasty, chocolate side to the malt that becomes quite apparent in the finish. It's very well-balanced with a bitterness seems to hide itself in the shadows but continually keeps things dry without ever building on the palate. Again, it's perfectly balanced and makes for an excellent session ale. There's enough character to keep it interesting throughout an evening; a brilliant balance that makes it workable; and a low enough alcohol that you can do it at a session pace.

Just a touch of fruity flavours lingers about, and there's a barely detectable note of medicinal in the back. Hops bring a gentle raw, leafy bitterness to the palate that both balances and intrigues. Dry, leafy and earthy in the finish. Notes: Naturally bottle-conditioned. I highly recommend that you stand the bottle to let the yeast settle and server at ~55F. With a careful pour, leave the dregs in the bottle. Quite possibly one of the most drinkable beers on the palate, where nothing overwhelms and all is in harmony. A top-notch session beer, to say the least, and much like a cask ale in the bottle. We need more real English-style bitters in the US. I'll have to write Congress.",2002-04-11,3152,HSB (Horndean Special Bitter)

The smell is typically English malty, with hoppiness in the background.  HSB starts off with a decided hop presence (I noticed it more on tap than I remembered in bottle) and firm bitterness, with a round, almost buttery malt to complement the hops. The hops are present throughout the sip, leaving a pleasant, just shy of unbalanced bitterness on the tongue along with the lingering malt flavors. As the brew warms, the malt comes to the forefront as expected. A very, very drinkable ale.",2002-03-27,3152,HSB (Horndean Special Bitter)

S: The smell has light to moderate aromas of toasted malts along with herbal hops and some hints of grassy hops. T: The initial taste has flavors of biscuit and toasted malts along with hints of caramel, toffee and sweetness. This transitions to flavors of earthy yeast and herbal hops, the latter of which contributes a light amount of bitterness. M: It feels light- to medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate to high amount of carbonation, making it seem a little airy. The earthiness contributes a little dryness towards the finish.

A vibrant, crisp, blood-ruby coloring with a slight ring of filmy, off-white head around the edge of the surface. Aromas of toffee richness and a tangy sweetness blend together for a subtle nose. Flavors are bitter forward and all over the tongue, with a subtle, rich toffee backbone that peaks its head around the corner every once in a while to keep things on an even keel. The richness almost has a syrupy quality to its flavor. A light bodied beer, this feels heavier with the richness of the flavors, but somewhat sharp with the carbonation and bitterness. A bittersweet aftertaste, with some roastiness to it. The beer has an almost smokey, light, and crisp finish. Tasty brew.",2012-03-23,20842,St. Patrick's Best

Nice chewy and dense malt on this, a little grassy. Hints of winter warmer like cinnamon, and dry spices. Taste is a bit missing. Faint grassy malt, with a slightly wet body. There's really nothing going on here I wish I could say something. Extremely light even for a bitter, but has a very crisp almost hot aftertaste, where most of the flavor seems to be.

As the head dissipated, the aroma remained fruity but less specifically apple and also more floral and malty. A tad earthy with hints of toffee, smoke and herbs. Sweet malt became most prominent with warming.  Taste: a nice mix of sweet caramel and toffee malt with spicy and herbal hop bitterness. Some apple fruitiness in the taste along with hints of prunes and other dark fruits.  Mouthfeel: medium body with enough carbonation to impart some tongue tingle.

The beer poured a crystal clear dark amber color that made a 2½-finger tan head. Head retention was OK and lacing was decent. I love the smell of this beer. Buttered biscuit aroma with some caramel sweetness underneath. Grassy English hops round out the smell. Nice blending of flavors. Biscuity malt, caramel, toffee, and butter flavors meld nicely with the earthy hops. Not really that bitter for an English bitter, but I liked it nonetheless. Light to medium mouthfeel with medium carbonation. I don't know what the actual price of these would be when found on the shelf as opposed to the discount bin, but I would recommend trying some if you can find then.

4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Review from BeerAdvocate Magazine Issue #40 (May 2010):  Two fingers of head leave an impressive lacing on the glass as its clear copper color shines in the light. Its biscuity and buttery aroma carries with a side of earthy hops. With the crisp, dry, malty body, smoothness wears well on this beer. With dry maltiness throughout, mineral or perhaps a hint of salt comes in as soon as the hop bitterness stings the palate. Herbal, woody, earthy hop flavor does very well against the dry biscuity maltiness. Tart apple skin, nougat and tea leaves come to mind. Buttery, fruity yeast keeps to a minimum but does lend enough flavor and complexity to give this ale an edge over many. Wow, what a treat!! This is clearly a great pick if in need of a solid session ale. Great job on this one.",2011-01-11,20842,St. Patrick's Best

Nothing special with this beer....kind of bleh looking actually. S- The aroma proved to be a little better than the apperance. Light roasted bittersweet malts clash with some light caramel malts. More earthy than floral hops in the middle to ending aroma. This wasn't too powerful in the nose but you could pick up these scents without burying your nose in the glass. T- Light toasted malts in the front end of this right off the bat. Caramel malts follow into the middle with some light citrus flavor. Earthy hops on the backend of this beer doesn't really shine at all and falls short of the aroma.  M- Light mouthfeel. Carbonation is high for the style I think. Goes with the beer sadly though. Light roasted malts left on the palate with some hop lingering in the aftertaste. Light drying on the palate and somewhat clean tasting.  D- This is a drinkable beer and high at that. This has to do with the fact that there isn't a high flavor in this. Good drinker for someone who is just starting into craft beer.

Smells of bready English malt with firm nodes of caramel and toffee and some light European hops. As is expected from such an august brewer, this is quite expertly composed. Tastes... different, but I grow to love it as the pint progresses. The word ""bitter"" has such a variable and contextual meaning. To an American pallet in, say, the 1980's, this would have probably seemed undrinkably rough. To a American beer person in the mid 2000's, it would have seem far too tame. But now that American IPA's have turned toward using smoother, fruiter hops, a sessionable English ESB again seems somewhat aggressive. But only somewhat. This beer is quite delicately composed--it could serve as a wonderful lesson for the legions of American brewers cranking out mediocre ""session IPAs"" as of late. The grainbill is, gasp, actually used as a source of flavor and complexity. The caramel and toffee start off lightly bitter and grow fruity as the beer progresses, with a bitter and lightly peaty finish bookending the flavor. Very nicely done.",2017-05-31,10403,Boltmaker

T: The taste follows the smell and has flavors of biscuit and cracker malts and buttery diacetyl along with notes of fruity yeast. There is a light amount of bitterness. Hints of mineral water are noticeable in the finish. M: It feels light- to medium-bodied and somewhat chewy on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.

Not hazy, but an interesting opaqueness to the clarity, with a fine sense of middle carbonation slightly which is surprising. Frothy and thick chunky head, off tan almost orange in color in a way, easily making three solid fingers and a clump thick retention with some very big bubbles. Real nice and neat looking brew. Toasty malts with an excellent sweet bakery sense. Big amounts of sweet cookie and a mild floral sweetness to go along with it. Muted brown sugar tones mix in with the malt quality as well, there might even be a bit of green herb poking out slightly. Real impressive aroma for a bitter. A faint dry brown bread crust even pops out with all the thick and light toffee quality as well, very nice. Palate manages excellent flavor. A real neat malt profile in the mid palate, light brown sugar with a biscuit warmth and actually dry slightly pine hop bent. Finishes with big toasty dryness and accented with hop bitterness that gets even a little earthy and tea warm. Toasty angle gets into a lot of nutty flavors, almost hazelnut tasting, but with a noticeable bitter sting. Mouthfeel and flavor comes off real light but supportive, and even a bit mineral as well. Bold but light. Session sensing, but full of rich flavors. There's a lot of complex qualities going on here for a bitter, a real nice rewarding brew to partake in.

Smell - The aroma of burnt caramel (And I mean that in a good way) is very evident. there is also some mild chocolate toffee and a little light prune and raisin in the mix here. The hop is mild to subdued in the aroma rather than assertive. Taste - Bitter pine and coffee hop suddenly assert themselves in the mix here helping to balance out the sweet burnt brown sugar/caramel malts. There was also a tiny hint of sulphur in the burnt elements of the taste but this did not range towards the egg end of the scale more the spent match head side of things.

4.15,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,"West Bank Pub Ale (on cask) 4.8% ABV Served in a shaker pint glass at the brewpub. Described by the brewery as, ""British style pale ale featuring the the rich character of UK Golden Promise malt with a distinct finish from the use of British Fuggles and Golding hops."" I think it was an American Pale Ale, and not an English style pale ale. I won't even bother reviewing it as an English ale because it would qualify as a horrible horrible example! Appearance 4.5/5 Amber orange hued with slight haze that's perhaps because of cask conditioning, this beer came with a dense, creamy and persistent off white head that left excellent lacing over the course of the pint. Aroma 4.5/5 Intense, intense hop aroma of American citrus hops, which is why it cannot be an English style bitter. Very good aroma, even if it's one-dimensional. Taste 4/5 Great bitterness and hop flavor riding on a rather thin body. One-dimensional again, but enjoyable nonetheless. Mouthfeel 4/5 Thin, which is not necessarily a fault in an ale at this ABV. Carbonation is lower than I would like but it could be the temperature and the fact that it's on cask. Drinkability 4.5/5 Good. A very nice low ABV option.

Looks a little dirty with the two tone head, like dirty ocean foam.  Smell is a bit of caramel, and some citrus hops.  Taste has a firm citrus hop flavor, definitely more west coast pale ale then English bitter in that department, which is fine by me!

You can tell this is an English style, with the hopping. If it's possible, this is an americanized-english ale, if that makes sense. An english bitter, traditionally not as bitter as american beers, yet this one is more hopped than its traditional english partners. Enough of the rant.

The taste wasn't grainy out right, but it reminded me of the smell of when I have a 12 pund bag of grains for homebrewing in my living room. Sure there were some pleasant hops in there, but it was just a sweet taste and smell of barley ready to be brewed up. It's almost like it was dry malted is you know what I mean. Either way it was tasty and felt like it deserved to be drank while eating the pub fries (if you try them you'll understand) but was still good nevertheless. It's tasty, give it a try.

Ends with a blazing flourish of hops. Again, all herbal and floral. Stems and leaves and buds and blossoms.  Kicks in roughly medium bodied.

Taste is well balanced starting with lightly toasted bread that keeps its share of the taste up til it starts with the hops which is just past midway and goes from there with some pretty favorable amounts of bittering hops, fresh and herbally grassy with sour pineyness and light puckering grapefruit rinds. Great lingering bitterness quality that also gives way to a bit of highly roasted nuts and more bread malts and yeast playing in with the bitterness. Quite a nice attachment.

Well-rounded, with a moderate sweetness, and a long, malt-infused finish. Each time the glass is lifted, satisfaction is ensured. Nutty malt flavor stays on top.

4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"500ml bottle, 3.5% ABV. Anything resembling an English pub bitter in these parts, done well, has my vote - let us see. Another new offering in Alberta that is only available in the large, soulless chain liquor store(s). This beer pours a crystal clear medium bronzed amber hue, with two fingers of tightly foamy, somewhat creamy off-white head, which leaves a low undulating berm of painted lace around the glass as it quickly dissolves. It smells of biscuity, somewhat metallic pale grain, an aged lemony fruitiness, and musty, floral, mildly bitter earthy hops. The taste is grainy, bready malt, a waning bready biscuit character, some soft indistinct orchard fruit notes, and nicely offsetting floral, bitter leafy hops. The carbonation is decently reserved - not absent, not interfering, the body medium light in weight, and everyman smooth. It finishes fairly dry, the mostly crisp, grainy malt seeing fit to share quality time with still prevalent, and softly bitter hops. Well, I can't really bitch and moan at all about anything here, other that the weird hegemony that brought this beer to me, which is not the brewer's fault (I hope), so I will say that this is an easy drinking bitter, definitely not too acerbic, and worthy of many another round, were that the situation.",2013-01-06,35153,Hooky Bitter

The taste brings in more of the same, with a blast of firm earth, oak, and tobacco really taking control, junta-style. Things just don't sit right with me, honestly, especially considering how much I prefer democracy. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a generally smooth feel.

Maybe it's the 3.5% as opposed to, say, 3.8%, but it just ends up insubstantial.  Hook Norton does better than this.",2012-07-30,35153,Hooky Bitter

Aroma of malt and fruitiness with a hint of diacetyl. mouthfeel: that soft but solid English Ale feel Taste: Biscuity malt gives way to a musty, earthy English hoppiness followed by a glaze of buttery toffee and a touch of fruitiness like dried plums or apricots. Hooky leaves just a hint of herbal bitterness in the aftertaste. Notes: pretty to look at, nice bouquet, supple in the mouth and a complex taste that lies in layer upon layer of the soil of England.

The nose is biscuity with a fistful of grains, dried flowers, corn husks, barley, dried orange peels, dead yeast cells, cellar stored apples and peaches, nothing distinctly malty but, by the same token, doesn't come across as devoid of malts. Light-bodied, consistent throughout so you don't sense any dropping off. Barley, wheat germ, corn, sorghum, and yeast, does a nice of job of alternating between bitter and sweet, the very active carbonation moderates between them. Caramel and maple syrup smooth some rough patches, still has a leafy finish. The lemon, orange citrus dry and focus things further. Ends with a kind of peppery kick.

Rather full-bodied without being too malt forward. I think this is an ale that Reminds me a bit of one of my home-brewed bitters served from a Party Pig. This beer really needs to be experienced a bit warmed up and not right out of the fridge to be enjoyed and I would guess that it really needs to be served from the cask to be fully appreciated.

Followed by floral and spicy hops with an edge of grassiness. Mild undertones of buttery diacetyl. Firm bitterness appears across the middle and lingers into the finish, gaining momentum as it goes. It finishes quick and dry with just a suggestion of malt and some spinning, swirling hints of spicy and floral hops left behind.

3.56,4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,"Bright tangelo with no yeast and few bubbles. The color of the beer is almost identical to the color of the label (see above). The crown is elephant tusk ivory and looks good too. It's also more than capable when it comes time to decorate the glass. The nose is... uh... subtle. There isn't much present other than faint, lightly toasted malt and even more faint herbal, earthy hops. Even session beers should smell like something. Having said that, flavor is much more important in my book. Thankfully, Hooky Bitter tastes better than it smells. It still isn't a palate challenger, but then show me a 3.6% bitter that is, or that was designed to be. Anyone at all, even those people who claim that they don't really like beer, should be able to drink a pint bottle with no trouble at all. What flavor is present tastes 'golden malty'. That is, it's slightly darker than pale and is akin to very lightly toasted white bread. The reason why the beer deserves an above average score is that there's just enough hop flavor (herbal, grassy, earthy) and bitterness to make the name a valid one. East Kent Goldings perhaps. Considering the ABV, the mouthfeel is well done and is bigger than your average 5.0% ale. The bubbles add needed energy without crossing the line into fizziness. This stuff is probably killer from a a cask... in an English pub... in Oxfordshire. As I understand the style, Hooky Bitter is a classic English bitter. Even though there's nothing here to get this big beer lover's pulse racing, I'm enjoying the simple elegance and the superb drinkability. The packaging is pretty impressive too.",2008-10-14,35153,Hooky Bitter

A constant flow of bubbles burst up towards the head throughout the tasting. The aroma was fairly sweet, hoppy and it had a very English Bitter type smell, as you would expect. Crisp, sharp and bitter in flavour, a very good example of an English Bitter.

T - Not sure but I think this is my first bitter so please bear with my thoughts. Not an overpowering beer (alcohol or taste) but a very refreshing light taste. Goes down very smooth. No really noted hop bitterness. There is just a tiny bit of bitterness well after the beer has left my mouth. But it is gone quickly. M - Smooth and light.

Moderate bitterness is mostly spicy, but a floral quality is there. A mild bitterness lingers through the slightly dry finish. M: Medium light body is more substantial than the beer's low ABV would lead you to expect. Carbonation level is just right. D: Not a super complex beer, but nice for a session.

No indication of its age on the bottle but it pours a clear light gold with a 1 finger head of foam. Very good head retention and there's some good lacing. Smell wise, it fits the style very well. Some sweet malty tones and a more than adequate nose of fruit. Seems promising. The taste is nice. I get big flavours of biscuit up front followed by some fruit and some lemony hops that comprise most of the finish. Good medium mouthfeel for the style and the carbonation is light. Hmmm....this is pretty tasty however ""old"" it is and I find it very drinkable. Still, I doubt that the bottle I'm drinking from would be found to be impressive by my cousins from across the pond. It just doesn't have that ""freshness"" factor that I look for in all the brews I try. Oh well, a 3.6%abv brew *is* very delicate, to say the least, and the fact that I enjoyed it probably says how good it must taste when sampled fresh.

3.68,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,"I found this in South Dakota at a place called Monk's. Talk about an odd finding in an unlikely place. This brew poured a nice golden yellow color w/ a light head atop. The head dwindled quickly after the pour. A little more carbonated than most bitters I've had, but still pretty good. The aroma wasn't very stong but you do get a slight floral hoppy aroma. This is followed by a grainy sweetness. The flavor is pretty solid, but nothing spectacular. Mild bitterness like a typical bitter followed by a soft malty sweetness. There is a mild hoppy aftertaste and flavor throughout the brew. Definitely not an American beer. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean. Finishes smooth. Overall a pretty solid bitter. Not the best I've ever had, but it is a reasonable choice in the bitterless US. I'd recommend it if you can find it in the US. If I was in England, I'd probably look for other choices first.",2008-05-19,35153,Hooky Bitter
3.97,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Pours with a stunningly, brilliantly clear light cranberry hue. It shows a rich copper hue when held up to the light. A vigorous pour produces a three-finger thick, light tan colored head. The aroma is a mix of soft malt and hop notes; it is a touch metallic, with a distinct cracker-like malt character, some light grassy hop notes, perhaps a hint of marmalade and a touch of fruitiness that becomes more noticeable as the beer warms up a bit. Lightly sweet malt greets my tongue at first, but then a bitter hop note rises up to challenge the malt and in fact lingers through to a long bitter finish. The beer is fairly light on the tongue, but does have a touch of malt body to keep it from being water-like. The flavors are balanced towards the hop character, though all of the notes are quite in line for a British Bitter. The malt &amp; yeast notes combine to contribute a touch of toffee flavors up front, some soft apple-like fruitiness. As the beer warms up a bit a touch of citrus-like hop flavors become noticeable as does a bit more of the herbal notes; this could use a touch more hop flavor, but really gets better once it warms up from the 50°F / 10°C serving temperature. I would say that the aroma is more malt balanced, while the flavor is clearly hop balanced; Each component plays a role though in both domains and even that fermentation character adds just a touch here an there. This stands out for being so low in alcohol, yet still being quite flavorful and eminently quaffable. It is perhaps a bit too hoppy, or really too bitter; I would have loved to see some more hop flavor characteristics here. What this really brings home is that I need to get to England to taste a whole lot of quality bitters. Quite an enjoyable brew. Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ",2008-04-01,35153,Hooky Bitter

A faint buttery note in the background. Tastes of caramel malt with a dry bitter finish. Notes of toffee, faint hints of aromatic citrus and a vague yeasty fruitiness. A mild stewed-hop bitterness upon swallowing. Hints of alcohol/solvent in the background. Mouthfeel is smooth, tingly and a little slick. Good body. Somewhat astringent.

Let's get straight to business as I'm a big English bitters fan and my beer is tantalising me with it's English bitter ways. Poured from a 500ml bottle into a conical pint. A: It's got a great brown ale look and feel to it. A rusty dirt coloured body with a very tasty creamy looking half centimeter head that beckons to the tasty creamy looking head lover in me... wait a sec, ""head lover"" sounds wrong... ahhh f**k it, I do love good head! S: You've got toasted biscuit and toffee malts with an odd (almost minty?) character... maybe it's the hops? Let's find out head lovers! T: This brew is malt central. We've definitely met our quota of malt here; toasted biscuit, caramel, toffee, we've got you covered. The classic bitter back note is easier on the taste buds than what we typically find in modern APA's and IPA's, but hey that's just how they did it in those days. It's a good, decent English bitter we have on our hands, something you would find in ye olde pub in Sussex or Kent. M: Decent and ale-like in the mouthfeel; light carbonation with a medium body. Easy on the palate. D: It's down to the dirty now - how does this compare with the other English bitters I've tried? Well it's not quite as tasty as the Pride of Oxford, however it does take the Hepworth &amp; Co ""Sussex"" bitters to the cleaners. Bear in mind though that Pride of Oxford isn't indicative of the style and if I was choosing a ""typical"" English bitters out for a friend who wanted to know what an English bitters is then Adnams would be the pick. Two words: English bitter. Food match: I would match this with a pie or Cornish pastie, some mash potatoes with gravy (or tomato sauce) and peas.

O - Perhaps a good pick for a bitter drinker, who wants something lighter and clean/refreshing. Not quite my thing to make a regular but pleased to have tried it. ps. I'm having another bottle of this today. The 'Beer info' in the header lists this as 4.1%, and shows a bottle with a mustard/ochre coloured lable. The bottle I have in front of me says it is 3.7% [the brewery website also confirms this]. This explains why in my original rating^ I suggested it tastes light for 4.1%; it no longer is!

The flavor was malty sweet with the expected diacetyl coming about and punching the aftertaste as expected. The mouthfeel was between light and medium bodied with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation was nice and low. ABV felt as projected. Smooth malty and buttery finish.

A deep golden color, small head, not particularly carbonated. Smell is fresh, a little minerally, tart. Taste is an immediate dash of light bitterness, followed by a sour tartness, a caramelly sweetness and fruity taste. Somebody else's description of it as ""marmalade"" is spot on -- the bitterness and fruity sweetness really work together to give that impression. There's a hint of minerals and gentle floral hops. After a while most of that dies down, and the bulk of the pint is a slightly tart mineral taste, with a gentle and delicious bitterness. The bitterness stays with you for a while too. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. This isn't an assertive beer, but it feels very well balanced and drinkable, very much in the English tradition, and in the end, is simply very tasty.

This beer has a lovely rusting hue that evokes long-sunken ships and farm implements left to rust in grown over ditches. It captures light like few other beers do, so it's a shame that there's no head retention or lacing to speak of. Nonetheless, these beers are meant to be drunk, not ogled, so we'll off to the taste, with just a quick nod to the rich, savory aroma - spun sugars, tea, toffee and dried fruits, like apricots. Terrific. I inhale deeply, greedily, with each sip. The beer has that typical bitter's flat wateriness that says ""You can drink six pints of me, but you'll still be sick in the morning"", but there's still plenty of flavor to savor. Those butter and orange pekoe tea notes are there in full force, but are contrasted by an assertive hop profile that rides on the tongue long after you've taken your sip. I guess it shouldn't be surprising that in a country where everyone drank tea, they brewed up something like tea that you get a mild buzz on, and I'm glad for it.

The beer was a pale gold, like almost all Oakham beers and like the bottle it had a slight haze in the body. The head being pure white with smallish bubbles. The head left a little lacing as I attacked the beer. The smell was citrusy, obviously from the hops, in the taste more bittering hoppiness came through. The bodyfeel was lightish and yet it seemed to hold hidden fruits within it. Never been a huge fan of this breweries beers, their yeast culture seems to dominate the flavours; without killing any other flavours admittedly, but always there somehow. My scores marry against my bottled review, very rare!",2011-10-08,4775,Jeffrey Hudson Bitter
4.22,3.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,"Handpump halfpint at the White Horse. A: Clear straw body under a 1/2"" of fine, frothy white foam. Pretty good retention and plenty of lace. Attractive, if very very light-colored for the style. S: Huh. It almost smells like a pilsner, with sharply herbal hops on top of dry, biscuity malt and accented by some chalky minerality. As it warms, some sweeter, fruitier notes show up with nice orange marmalade standing out. Interesting and enjoyable. T: Surprisingly sweet, with caramel, toffee, and sweet orange leading the way to a cleanly bitter, herbal finish. Very clean aftertaste. Excellent. M: Typical, perfectly soft cask carbonation filling out the light body. Very nice indeed. O: The other Oakham beer's I'd had were terrific, so I was very excited to try this one. My initial reaction was one of confusion and potential disappointment, but by the time it warmed and I managed to peer into its flavorful depths, I was completely won over. Distinctive, delicious beer. Cheers!",2011-06-21,4775,Jeffrey Hudson Bitter

Free beer for anyone at the bar. Slightly warmer than cask ale usually is. Cloudy golden amber hue with bits of sediment floating in the beer. A very thin head, due to the low carbonation and lack of any agitation of going through a beer engine or gravity pump. Very light biscuity malt aroma with a little bit of an earthy yeast aroma. The flavor was somewhat citrusy, reminding me of orange peel. The malts added a little bit of bitterness. I hope to try this one sometime from a non-busted firkin.

Thin in a good way though, since the thinness of the aromas made the malt aromas very sharp. The taste had a bit of a flatness to it but those malts and hops allowed it to be a sour-sweet dynamic.

It seems every real ale drinker at the pub held a pint of it at the time of my visit, surely it proves very popular in the summer! A: it pours a very pale-yellowish hue, almost like some light cider or pale lager, coming with an incredibly tight but quite thin white beerhead, leaving extremely dense lacing as well. Looking great for a cask ale, or, even like a decent Pilsner w/o the fizz. S: note of freshly-squeezed, sweetened lemon-juice approaches first, followed by a touch of white grape-fruit zesty scent. No trace of salty note this time, while some wild, leafy aroma of hops sustains at the back. T&amp;M: refreshingly light bitterness of grape-fruit peel and nectarine-like juicy flavour present on the palate. The finish has long-lasting hoppy bitterness prevailing at the back of my throat; the aftertaste is simple but extremely nice and balanced, with dryish and rounded mouthfeel at the same time due to the residual sweetness given by the malts.  D: at just 3.8%abv, this light, hoppy, ""Golden Ale"" has all the flavour one might expect of a much richer brew.

This beer appears a clear pale golden amber hue, with one finger of wanly puffy, loosely foamy dirty white head, which leaves a single broad patch of snow rime lace on the glass as things slip away. It smells of lightly biscuity, bready caramel malt, ripe apple and pear, and bucolic earthy, leafy hops. The taste is sweet, somewhat pastry-like biscuits coated in a thin film of caramel candy, a more subdued drupe fruitiness, a wee hard water minerality, and earthy, floral, and weedy old-school hops. The carbonation is quite light and innocuous, the body an adequate medium weight, and mostly smooth, with a mild pithiness. It finishes well off-dry, the fruitiness kind of overshadowing any lingering hop bitterness or malt crispness. A serviceable bitter, however, the sweetness is dialed up a bit too much, the drying bitterness of the name sort of hard to appreciate. I don't think that I could session this, in the manner of John Smith's, et al, as I did in the increasingly distant past.

Pours a very clear golden colour, slightly darker in the deeper placed. Head is relatively full and white, persisting as a very fine, almost creamy film that leaves some patterned lacing. Carbonation is very fine. Looks pretty decent. Skunky, light-struck aroma at the start, brisk and green and pungent—I'm actually not averse to that smell, although it does tend to dominate everything else. Once the volatiles are gone, and I've swirled it a few times, some other characters come through: mild earthy hops and a deep caramel and reduced condensed milk character. Some plasticky remainders of the light struck character continue to the end however. Taste is a little weak, but not unpleasantly so. Mild sweaty hops are noticeable from start to finish, although they're something of a constant—they don't swell and ebb or express themselves very dynamically. Underneath is a reasonably constant malt character, with a slightly aromatic edge that gives a faint lemon and carob tone when set against the hop presence. Feel is cool and smooth with just a slight prickle from the carbonation. Overall, it's decent stuff. I'll try it again sometime from a bottle that's not clear and not so clearly light-struck, but given that's how it comes there's not much I can do about it.

Distinct and overwhelming buttery aroma with hints of caramel. All other notes are lost/overpowered. Not sure if this is how it's supposed to be, but it isn't good. Taste of light malt with a strong buttery note. Despite the description on the label, I'm not detecting any aromatic hops whatsoever. Notes of stewed leaves, followed by a rather dry bitter finish. Mouthfeel is slick and leaves the palate dry. Faint buttery aftertaste. Not good at all. Lots of buttery flavour, which I presume to be due to the presence of diacetyl. This is the latest of a number of Badger brews I've tried that are afflicted by this characteristic - I'm beginning to wonder if it's deliberate or if I'm just particularly sensitive?

S: semi-sharp hop resins, a clean, spicy-citric hop aroma (with a light hint of white grapes and fruit gum) and lightly salty-sweet maltiness dominate the theme - pretty attractive actually, albeit not complex. T: the sprizty foretaste features salty-sweet malts and pronounced tangerine-ish and floral-bitter hoppiness, then a light but hard-to-miss ""table cloth""-like biscuity malts (a typical feature of all Badger's ales I've had) provides a lingering aftertaste to complement the hoppy theme; finishing with a yet another sting of late hopping, slightly chewy and dry in the end. M&amp;D: the palate is a sharper than necessary due to the high carbonation level, otherwise the body and overall texture could've been ideal for the moderate flavour profile and the hoppiness could've been appreciated fully.

Dry and a little bitter overal. The dryness gave way to a metallic feel in the mouth and aftertaste, this didn't help the tasting at all.

Apparently this ale is named after the owner of a brewery that was subsequently taken over by Brains. Poured into a tulip pint glass. A deep reddish-amber colour with good clarity and medium carbonation. Forms a large head of creamy white foam that lasts for a few minutes before subsiding. Aroma of grainy malt with notes of caramel, biscuits, mild dried fruit, ale yeast, grass and stewed hops. Dry and slightly earthy. Tastes of biscuity malt with a dry finish. Notes of caramel, mild grain, fruity yeast esters, grass/hay, hints of dried fruit and stewed hops. A wet cardboard flavour lurks in the background. Possesses an earthy character, with a restrained bitterness upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth and tingly, with pleasant carbonation and good body. Somewhat astringent, with an aftertaste of stewed leaves, harsh cardboard and faint caramel malt. Meh - not terrible but a pretty average ale. Looks OK, however both aroma and flavour are boring in a traditional sort of way. Grainy malt and subtle hops with a light bitterness. It is well balanced, but that alone doesn't make a stand-out beer. I'll damn it with faint praise by admitting that it's a shade better than some of Brain's other popular offerings.

This beer pours a clear, bright brassy copper colour, with three fat fingers of light tan creamy melted marshmallow head, which settles very slowly, eventually leaving a few broad swaths of sudsy lace around the glass in its wake. It smells of lightly roasted, fairly sweet malt, some nice drupe-like fruitiness, and a mild earthy hoppiness. The taste is a more astringently bready malt, kind of metallic, the fruitiness tempered almost wholly, and the hops turning fairly green, leafy, and bitter. The carbonation is low, but still noticeable, the body medium-light in weight, and a bit prickly on its way to a just-adequate smoothness, given the initial nitro-esque qualities. It finishes off-dry, the metal edge (can't think of any Welsh metal bands) still there, amongst a feeble resurgent fruitiness. Such a pretty, inviting offering - too bad it turned out so sharp, well, sharp in the English mild ale sense.

3.76,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"500ml bottle purchased from Sackville Cellars in Rozelle, a nice little bottlo that often has some interesting beers. Pours a very deep reddish copper colour, with an initially frothy and large-bubbled head of beige, that settles down to a pleasant, fine English film. Body is light, and there's a surprisingly vivacious amount of carbonation, but otherwise it looks good. Nose is a bit mean on aroma, giving up little besides a touch of earthy hops and a very minimal crushed petal freshness. It's all extremely restrained to the point of boredom. Had better. Taste is a lot better, incredibly smooth and mild, with a good nutty grain character towards the centre and a touch of earthy, slightly twanging metallic hops to finish up. Very smooth and clean, but with that subtle, comforting body that English ales do so well. Very drinkable brew, if very much in the milder-is-better, balance-is-everything mould of the old school of English brewing.",2011-08-25,6201,Old Leg Over
3.7,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,"After Pretty Things Hedgerow was not a huge hit for me, and talking to Dan Paquette about it i realized I had to start getting into more English Bitters and really learn the style, and maybe even start to like them. So here's another to try. Pours a semi frothy smaller 1/4 finger head that just sticks around like it was meant to be there, over a semi clear but slight yeast chunked rosy reddish slight orange-brown colored beer. Nose actually brings more sweetness and malts than hops, some brown sugar, molasses, light syrupy, plenty of brownish sweeter malts, crystal malts, soft slightly aged malt aromas, slight candy, and I half expect a slight boozy aroma but it never comes. As my nostrils quickly get used to the malts and sweetness, some light bitterness comes through, a very slight earthy and herbal hop not so much the herbal that I'm not a big fan of though, just vegetative oily herbal. Taste follows a similar pattern, starting first with a sweet malty kick, a bit of brown sugar and hint of molasses, a bit of a candy flavor, caramelized malts, a nutty like malt flavor, a bit of fruit comes through with it thanks to the yeast I think, slight fig like fruit, and a soft aged malt with plenty of medium brown malts, again I half expect some booze to kick in but never comes (the difference between a beer from U.K. and U.S. I think). Then some bittering hops, not much, it gets slightly bitter but not what I was expecting. The hops bring a very light oily vegetative herbal taste. Then I get a bit of oxidation coming through, possibly in the transportation and who knows how long it was sitting on the shelf. Finishes with a slight sweetness that seems to dry like a Belgian candi sugar finish would do, a bit more soft malt tastes, molasses, and very slight bitterness with herbal hops lingering.  Mouth is a bit richer and heavier bodied but not much, and decent carbonation. Overall not bad, not what I was expecting. Nice malt flavors, the hops and bitterness were nowhere on target if it were a bitter. The slight oxidation takes away from it a bit as well. It was more like a mild than anything, perhaps being mislabeled on BA as I don't see it mentioning being a bitter on the bottle. It calls itself more of an ale of old the style that would come from a cask, and so I will judge this beer more like that than what I was expecting for a bitter.",2011-06-08,6201,Old Leg Over

This is a nice beer to ""kick-back and relax with"". It is not a particularly demanding flavor yet it is not so subtle to be a nonentity on the palate. Mouthfeel is very cordial-- in keeping with its demur flavor profile. Drinkability is superior owing to it's low ABV and mild flavor. I forgot what I paid of this beer.

The taste starts out neutral with a slight sweetness and some patent malt with a buttery finish but not strongly so. Patent malt roast and dry fuggles finish about defines this beer. There is a little nutty flavor too this but this seems under flavored to me. The mouthfeel is OK. Certainly easy to drink and it won't interfere with what ever you are eating.

3.48,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,"Transparent tawny with bright tangerine trim; a bit more orange than iced tea. The golden ecru head is more bubbly than it is foamy, but is dense enough to persist quite nicely. Actually, I like the look of hundreds of glassine bubbles piled on top of one another. As an added bonus, they provide tremendous looking lace when they pop. The nose could be stronger. What I'm able to appreciate is balanced in the way that most English Pale Ales are balanced. Lightly toasted pale malt and classically fruity-earthy Brit hops combine into a pleasant aroma, if not an overly compelling one. OLO is decent beer and would make a pretty fair session ale, but it just doesn't have enough guts for me, enough flavor. I'm loath to blame the 4.1% ABV since I've heard from enough people that ABV has very little to do with flavor (debatable). Besides, I've had plenty of sub-5% beers that had a leg--or two--up on Old Leg over with regards to taste bud saturation. The beer is balanced on the palate as well, although with such a deficit of both malt and hops, it's hard for either one to speak with too loud a voice. Minimally toasted pale malt and mildly bitter, tea-like hops make up the flavor profile; along with a lot of water. Warming brings about no increased flavor density and nothing of interest. I'll cut the flavor some slack given its innocuousness and the dictates of the style, but I just can't be as kind when it comes to the body/mouthfeel. It's thin, thinner, thinnest without enough carbonation to add interest. Ease of drinkability is aided if that's your primary concern. Flavor is mine. The name Old Leg Over refers to what fell runners (British cross country runners) have to do in order to get across stone walls and streams during the course of their races.

The nose delivers a combination of delicately mineralish (hard water?) and subtly toasty caramelish malt, grassy/leafy hops, and a touch of yeasty fruitiness. Overall, it's very clean and fresh! Across the palate it's incredibly smooth but not quite creamy, or even slickly oily. It's delicate, very-fine bubbled and restrained carbonation (@1.9 volumes CO2) lightly caresses the tongue; and it's medium-light body gives it some mouthfeel.

It's superbly balanced by an underlying bitterness; and it's quite ""rounded"" and drinkable with a malty/fruity swagger that wanders into a dry finish with a touch of lingering nutty and caramelish malt. WOW! What a truly great session ale this one is! Balanced towards sweet malt, but not so heavy-handed in that (how could it be?

4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"341ml bottle, at Wunderbar, in the fading afternoon light, which actually matters at a place like this. Same fire hydrant imagery as its brethren, speaking out from the label. This beer pours a slightly hazy, medium golden orange amber hue, with two fat fingers of puffy, frothy, and light whipped cream off-white head, which leaves some nice coral reef lace around the glass as it lazily drops away.  It smells of bready, rather biscuity caramel malt, dry field honey, leafy pine needles, and bitter generic citrus pith. The taste is just as well balanced, with a goodly dose of biscuity caramel/toffee malt, neutered lemon and orange fruit rind, ethereal Tootsie Roll notes, and further leafy, grassy hops. The carbonation is moderate, just a wee zesty frothiness throughout, the body an adequate medium weight, a tad prickly, but mostly smooth. It finishes with a drying leafy citrus edge, amongst all that proprietary English malt goodness. A nicely hopped-up bitter, bordering on Canadian IPA territory - you know, English sentiment blended with American practicality, and all that. Would happily have again, at non-bar prices, in larger amounts, and with more ambient light, so I could see the (as now, imaginary) people I would be enjoying this with.",2011-02-01,32569,SOB (Special Old Bitter)

A - Pours a nice golden orange colour, slight haze, solid finger of light bubbly head, sticky draping lacing and some nice visible carbonation on the body. S - Scent is fruity with orange citrus hops dominating the nose, complemented by some sweet caramel apple malts. T - Wonderful flavour on this one. The fruity citrus hops again dominate, but aren't overly bitter. The sweet caramel, though subtle, also comes through nicely. The finish is woody with cedar and pine lingering. M - Consistent with the style the finish is a little dry, but is not offensive. Nice medium bodied ale, with light carbonation that finishes nice and smooth. D - This one really surprised me. I've seen it several times before, but never picked it up. It is now definitely a part of my arsenal for hoppy session beers.

Mild toffee up front in the flavour, light orange esters in the middle, dry spicy hop finish, clean aftertaste. Actually gets a bit sweet in the aftertaste as it lingers, a dry sweetness.

Appearance: A hazy, dark honey body with a thick, 3 finger head that gradually recedes to 1 finger but lasts a good while. Very nice. Smell: Spices, caramel, malt and a bit of hops. Taste: A coppery, mineral-like aspect. Good presence of bitter hops and a nice spicy edge to it. The taste hits more after i swallow. Very distinct taste. Mouthfeel: Very smooth at first then gets a little harsh in the aftertaste. Carbonation is average. Not bad. Drinkability: The only impediment is the roughness of the taste a little bit but it still drinks very well. Half my glass without me even realizing it.

Lots of floral hops on the nose, with biscuity malt hiding in behind.  The flavour is interesting. Is there a mixture of english and C* hops in here? The overtones are english, but I get this little kick of grapefruity resinousness in the finish. Fascinating. It's also a touch more hoppy than your bog-standard to-style bitter, but I'm quite ok with that. I'd call this one a Pacific-Northwest bitter, in the best way possible. It is to traditional bitters what the American IPA is to traditional IPA.  Light carbonation and a silky smooth but low-key body make this an excellent session beer. Beautifully done Pump House!

4.22,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,"Picked this one up on a trip to Canada. Golden apperance with a light shade of orange. Loads of carbination stream up to form a frothy head. Nice lacing left on glass. Upon opening, light wiffs of bittering hops fill the air. Great nose. Sweet malts balance with bitter hops. Some hints of honey too. Mild bitter punch right off the first taste. Mixing in is some light grain flavors. Some green grassy and sweet malt are detected. Some more bitter hops hang around to finish off drink. Almost a medium mouthfeel. Drink is clean and fresh. Welcoming bitterness hangs on tounge. In this reviewers opinion, one of Pump Houses better offerings. Has some fresh hopped brewed qualities. Just wish brewers wouldn't put awards they recieved over a couple years old. It tells me they haven't done anything good since then.

Appearance: I was expecting a darker brew, but instead was surprised by the orange appearance, but that is just my limited experience. Nice head and lacing though Smell: Citrus, pine Taste: I got overwhelming taste of hops and pine. Again, this isn't what I was expecting, so that might influence my rating. Not that its bad, but simply not a taste that I lean towards.

Receding to leave a thick collar and sticky lace drapery.  Color on this is amber with some glowing golden hues when held to light. Aroma is light with little output, smells faintly of caramel, fermented honey, cocoa nibs, Vienna malt and a touch of rye. Taste is pretty nutty upfront with caramel malt sweetness. Aspirin kicking into full gear midway through and bitters dominating the finish, lingering long. As it warmed carmel sweetness and malt become a bit more prominant, balancing the bitters much more.  Metallic flavors and aspirin hop flavors are the dominant taste, which are a bit trying on my palette.  Overall a great bitter with some good attributes, but overall not my favorite.

Excellently balanced flavours with the malts manifested in caramel and berries, while the hops bring a good dose of bitterness in the form of orange, pine and flowers. Quite light bodied, but refreshing and not watery in the least. This is a great rendition of a bitter, and that's coming from an Englishman. The hopping is a touch higher than you'd find in the UK, but certainly short of your typical IPA. The most impressive part of this beer though is its excellent balance. Nice stuff!

Really attractive colour and stands out. Two fingers of head drop to a thin ring of foam with lacing down the glass.  The smell is mostly of piney hops and peach. It's also quite good. I don't think I've noticed peach on other beers but this one (as another reviewer noted) has definitely got them.  Taste is all hops initially. After they have subsided some light fruit from the yeast and malted sweetness makes it's way through - but then a long drawn out bitternesscomes back into play. It's good and very refreshing, but lacking a little in balance. That said it's definitely interesting and keeps you entertained. Mouthfeel is good if not a little over-carbonated but this doesn't really affect drinkability. As mentioned earlier it's very refreshing and such an active beer I can see these going down really well back to back. A great beer overall.",2009-06-11,32569,SOB (Special Old Bitter)

This was moderately sweet upfront with flavors of toffee and biscuits. The finish is grassy, herbal and lemony.

Served in a traditional Imperial pint glass, the beer had a light amber color with a small head that lingered in the glass. Carbonation was light and the beer was served at the typical cask conditioned temperature of around 50-55 degrees. Aroma was fruity and malty with a hint of flowery hops in the nose. Taste was fruity as well, but finished with a light hop bitterness. Mouthfeel was light in the palate and very smooth. This is without a doubt a session beer. I could have easily downed 3 or 4 pints if not for the fact that I planned to do some more drinking later in the evening.

This is a beer for the eyes to savor for a little while. Nose was pleasant and welcoming, warm with roasted malts, mildly sweet and ripe with warm bread - very inviting. Its nice and even on the tongue, with no real noticable peaks, somewhat malted. It slides into a soft hop peak on the pallete, then vanishes into a clean throat feel with an equally clean aftertaste.

After the generous 20oz. hand-pumped English-pub style glass arrives with the final steps of the cascade still flowing, one is captured. The beer is served ""warm"" maybe 55+ degrees F. This difference in temperature sky rockets the smell of this beer into a new dimention, really bringing out the hops in it. The taste is dangerous in the sense that you find yourself diving in for more to try and identify the carmel and cereal like flavors along with the more presence of hops. Creamy smooth goodness runs all the way from lips down ones throught, very refreshing.

Clear amber with larber than usual head for cask (this was a first pour off a new cask). Nose is light, but definitely towards the floral end of the hop spectrum.

Kentish Ale! [said with a pause in the middle with an overtly ridiculous American movie trailer voice] However it isn’t. It’s just a beer. A beer by Shepherd Neame nonetheless but still a beer [I so wanted to see “Master Brew Kentish Ale” on the T-box, but oh well *pops open bottle*]. Poured from a you-know-what-size-it-is into you-know-which-receptacle, aka 500ml/nonic pint. A: Clear auburn-copper body with a foamy off-white 1 cm head that wont actually just quit. I don’t know how Shepherd Neame do it but all their beers look exactly the same, least the ones I’ve tried... just as well it’s a good look for an EB. 7/10. S: All their aromas are similar too... do you reckon Shepherd Neame distribute the same product in different packaging and the joke’s on us? I swear I had a Spitfire the other day and the aroma was exactly the same... toffee/caramel malts, fruity/earthy hops and a restrained tea leaf tannin in the background. Straight up English Bitter goodness right ‘ere! 7/10. T: Verbatim what I wrote for Spitfire applies: “Balanced flavour here; the hops add a citrus tang and the caramel malts come through on the back palate”... Shepherd Neame I like you but you are seriously ‘aving a larf. If I could taste a point of difference this one has a bolder herbal bitter note in the finish but otherwise this brew is a definite bed mate to Bishops Finger and Spitfire, the fact that those other brews are decent reflects on this similarly tasting brew. Metal note implies some classic copper vats used in the brewing process and a slight distraction. 7/10. M: It’s not all “good news goats” with a carbonation that is distractingly “burpy” for lack of a better descriptive, body is mid to light and spot on though. 5/10. D: Not bad as usual Mr. Neame. This is a decent enough EB that doesn’t wow but at the same time it doesn’t disappoint either - it’s like the ale version of long-relationship sex - gets the job done. My only gripe is how gassy it is - it certainly doesn’t facilitate the ‘slamming down pints Dave Lister style’ drinking that I know and love, I’ve really had to pace myself with this one, maybe that was Shepherd Neame’s plan all along... 6/10.

Clear &amp; lively looking. Some caramel malts at the start with a sort of metallic aroma and some vanilla hops. There was also a few grassy notes and a bit of toffee coming together to give a sweet aroma. Light malts and sweet flavours to begin, namely some caramel and perhaps a touch of vanilla from the nose. There was a sort of bitter, earthy taste around the middle and a touch of fruit at the end. Light medium and as expected a pretty smooth beer on the palate. Carbonation was noticeable but nothing overly strong and there was a dry, semi-bitter finish. This one was pretty standard overall on the palate but it wasn't the most well balanced. A standard ale with quite a nice aroma and a good bit going for it but the flavours, although nice, were a nit muddled and not balanced well which the beer suffered for in the end.

Tastes of roasted malt with hints of caramel and a dry bitterness. Notes of fruity yeast, roasted grain and leafy stewed hops. Decent hoppy bitter finish. Mouthfeel is slick, prickly and astringent - leaves the palate dry. Aftertaste of bitter roasted malt and stewed hops. A fairly typical Shepherd Neame brew - pedestrian. The roasted malt and house yeast dominate the taste/aroma, but there is little in the way of aromatic hops. Lacks depth, and the mouthfeel is thinner than it could be.

Hops for me won the aroma stakes, malted biscuits coming in second and last, couldn't find anything else, but this isn't a complicated brew. No strong, powerful flavours here, just a pleasant mix of Kentish Hops and Crystal malts which produce a typical Southern English Ale/Bitter.

2.93,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,"A 500ml bottle with a BB of July 2012. ABV is stated as 3.8%. Picked up recently from an off-licence. Label lists the ingredients, including sugar, E150c and E450 - not convinced these are really needed. Poured into a Sam Smith's pint glass. A clear golden-amber colour with medium carbonation. Forms a decent head of white foam that lasts for a minute or so before subsiding. The aroma is pretty weak - a faint hint of grainy caramel malt and little else. Tastes of grainy caramel malt with a dry finish. Slightly sweet, with a faint hint of stewed hops. Pretty mild, not much bitterness to be found. Mouthfeel is smooth, tingly and reasonably full-bodied. Not much aftertaste; just a whisper of malt. Surprisingly bland, particularly for a bitter. It's more like a mild really; hardly any hop presence. The balance is OK and it doesn't have any flaws - it just fails to excite me on any level. It's best characteristic is the body, although I wonder if the added stabiliser plays a part in this. At any rate, drinkable but nothing special.

T - Pale malts, cereals, grass, paper-cardboard, hops are quite delicate, too much so, leading to an underwhelming finish.  MF - Has a certain creaminess, nice to swirl in the mouth, the pleasant part of this beer. O - Not the 'best bitter' proclaimed on the bottle by any stretch of the imagination, yes, it's drinkable but I'd give it a miss comparing it to similar bitters.  Also, I do not like the way this beer has added ingredients, the colourant and the stabilizers. It just seems a bit needless and goes against the craft brewing ethos.

This bottle is at 3.8%abv., BB 30/01/2011, served cool in a straight imperial pint glass. A: the colour is lighter than what I remember from the past (cask version) - light reddish amber, with good clarity, very mild fizziness and a well-lasting light beige froth on the top. S: quite sweet in terms of maltiness, somewhat like melted barley candy really, mixed with a hint of sweet red beans, honey, dark sugar, and hard-to-discern hop aroma - like sweet barley tea without much aroma, almost. T: the foretaste gives a good hint at burned sugar and brown sugar, a bit too simplistically sweet, followed by lightly sour but still sweet flavour like ripe plum-flesh or other types of stone-fruits... the aftertaste reveals a drier palate rendered by the tea-ish hops, but not quite bitter and yet slightly rough in terms of texture.

Very little aroma, some slight hop esters and hints of malted biscuits, typical mass produced English Bitter to be honest. The taste is a good enough mix of malts and hops, nothing spectacular, but nothing wrong with it either. A bit thin in the body stakes, even for a 3.8% beer and a little too fizzy for my liking.

A: pours a pale copper hue, coming with a well-lasting, light beige frothy head and constant but moderate carbonation. S: the nose is utterly aromatic, with a yeast-hop mixture as of Belgian Ales - peardrops, sweet fresh longan-fruits (likely from crystal malts), lychee-like juicy hops, a touch of pine sprigs and flowery scent (apparently from American hops), muted but enticing banana-esters (from Belgian pale ales), and a very settled tinge of roast tea leaves. So vivid, complex, and delicious. T: immediately developing upfront is a lychee-shell like aromatic hoppiness (resulting from dry-hopping?), sending an impressive wave of chewy and tannic bitterness that is slightly piney with a lightly tannic feel of citrus seeds, on top of crystal malts and burned sugar... the incredible length of bitterness and settled hop flavour linger well till the very end. Overall, despite being very bitter, the flavour remains refined throughout... M&amp;D: creamy soft on the texture, medium-bodied, balanced, very well bottle-conditioned (I guess?)... All in all, I find this more like an American PA added with exotic yeasty twists and tremendous bitterness of an IPA - maybe it can be called an American Bitter?

The taste is bitter  is it really a bitter, I think it borders to an IPA  with lots of fruitiness and creamy sweet malt. The aftertaste is not as bitter, there are notes of butter, dried apricots and other exotic fruits, a mild sour-yeasty mineral taste with a touch of butterscotch.

Dry (chalky) and smooth as it goes down the hatch. Drinkability: While I am not a hophead, I like this beer quite a lot (could it be the Chinook or Cascade hops?

The well-developed smell is of sweet fruits, perhaps peaches, flowers, rasberries, 7-up and lime. The taste is predominantly bitter, sweet and bready.

Slight, polite English hops on the back with a touch of lemon zest adding just a hint of tang, but yeah, there's nothing here - it's a high volume session ale that's sacrificed flavour for drinkability.

3.53,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A 500ml bottle with a BB of June 2012. The label mentions that it is named after a character from Cornish folklore. Poured into a Sam Smith's pint glass. A hazy orange-amber colour with high carbonation. Produces a massive head of creamy off-white foam; this lasts for ages before eventually subsiding to a thick surface layer. Aroma of subtle malt with notes of dry yeast, mild citrus and a hint of soap/detergent(!?). Slightly sweet. Tastes of grainy crystal malt with a dry finish. Notes of earthy yeast and subtle aromatic citrus. A faint spiciness on the tongue, but little bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth and dry, with decent body and prickly carbonation. Somewhat astringent. Aftertaste of dry yeast. Not bad - a tasty session ale. Quite yeasty, though I suspect this is because I've hung on to the bottle for too long. Wouldn't mind if the aromatic hops were a shade more pronounced. Drinkable - worth sampling.",2012-05-24,12971,Betty Stogs

3.8,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,"500ml bottle. The first Cornish ale that I've encountered? Maybe. For me, I'm more reminded of another Simpsons-ism: ""Skinnner!"". Or the X-Files. Or, ok, onto the product at hand. This beer pours a clear, bright medium copper hue, with one finger of puffy and bubble bursting ecru head, which leaves a low wash of island shore lace around the glass as it evenly subsides. It smells of biscuity, bready malt, with a nice sourdough undercurrent, mild aged citrus, and a soft earthy spiciness. The taste is more spicy in its demeanor, subtly bleeding over the still prominent toasted biscuit malt and burgeoning citrus hops, revealing itself as a leafy, low-grade red bell pepper zinginess. The carbonation is a tad prickly at moments, but tame overall, the body an enveloping middleweight, and quite smooth. It finishes off-dry, the malt teetering a bit further toward things bready, and the spice petering out for the most part. A bit of a surprise, I must say - everything going for a spot-on English bitter, all accented, augmented, abused, whatever, by the hop-borne (I assume) spicy notes that linger throughout. That said, I liked it.",2012-04-24,12971,Betty Stogs
3.63,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,"Nice bitter - dark amber with a big, white head (probably due to the bottle conditioning). Nice biscuity malt scent with spicy hops. Well balanced in the nose.  Toasty, biscuity malts with a bit of a creamy background and a good hop kick. Citrus and spice from the hops. Dry, grainy taste at the finish. Nice mouthfeel, a bit bright but not bad.

The taste is of Cornwall alright, that punchy slight peppery bitterness that spreads across the tongue and slides so easily down the mouth slightly lacking in carbonation such is how I remember drinking local beer down there. All of those elements that played on the nose dance round the palate.  Thin and crispy lol light and breezy  I can see why they label it a session beer",2011-11-11,12971,Betty Stogs
3.45,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,"Coming in a 500ml brown bottle, not bottle-conditioned; BB 17/11/2010, served cool in a straight imperial pint glass. NOTE: This ale was awarded Champion Best Bitter of Great Britain, GBBF 2008. A: pours a clear amber hue, coming with restrained streams of carbonation and a well-lasting off-white creamy/frothy head. S: rather juicy upfront, featuring English orangey-citric hops, plus a light touch of yeasty sourness; a good swirl helps bring out a really light and enticing tinge of honey and a little cream (both from the maltiness I presume), while pale malt's biscuity note keeps a low profile in the background. T: interesting - the lightly flowery flavour of hops and boiled-yum like taste are coupled with biscuitiness of pale malts (with the unique tinge of aromatic-flavour that I often relate to ""dirty kitchen cloth""), ensued quite closely with a lingering aroma of floral hops and a strangely semi-zesty bitter edge as of English hops. The finish seems to arrive rather prematurely, leaving a low level of bitterness in the end and an unusually clean palate for a Bitter (quite like Young's Bitter, in a sense). M&amp;D: despite being non-bottle-conditioned, the texture is retained well like a natural ale without (excessive) input of artificial CO2, going well with the light body, and a rather clean mouthfeel (due to thorough fermentation I suppose). Alas, the flavour falls slightly mediocre and not like the cask-conditioned version I've tried on several occasions, where hops enjoy a better presentation. Still, not bad, but this bottle can't do justice to the true quality of this ale and certainly fails to make a point of how the accolade at the GBBF 08 was won.",2009-09-28,12971,Betty Stogs

Pours a chestnut brown with a bubbly off-white head with nice retention. Leaves nice, satisfying bubbly foam down the glass. Sweet malt with some nice subtle fruity notes in the nose. Very nice balance with the malt backing and the nice fruity hops. I'm getting hints of green apple and sugar plum. Quite lovely. And one of my favourite bitters. Smooth and light-ish mouthfeel. A truly delightful and exceedingly drinkable bitter and very refreshing to boot. I tried a number of the 3 Judges other offerings but kept coming back to this.

Hazy deep amber hue, it tops with thick silky off-white head that withstands with excellent retention before slowly subsiding to thin layer of eternal foamy crown, lots of sticky lacing appeared along the glass-side. Hop obviously overcomes malt in a nose and quite inviting (thanks to the dry hopped part) with varieties of aroma ranging from citrus, passion fruit, ripe mango, floral, resin, grassy, and herbal while malt with background notes of caramel and toffee. You can get much of malty goodness in the flavor. It nicely harmonizes with hop profile with notes of bread and caramel while hop mainly provides a note of citrus together with herbal, grassy and moderate bitterness at the end. Overall, the taste is not much juicy and fruity as reflected in the aroma but tends to be more pronounced on malt. Medium body with smooth mouthfeel and lively carbonation generated generous amount of frothy wave through the palate, finish is rather dry. This beer is a pretty good mix between English Bitter and American Pale Ale. In my opinion, I think it tends to be likely more on American side with a notable hop character.",2016-09-02,43289,Licht & Lustig
3.62,3.25,3.75,3.75,3.25,3.5,"330ml bottle, now with the more general black and white De Molen labeling. This beer pours a, well it doesn't really pour, per se, but rather comes spewing out of the bottle upon cap popping, so good on me for immediately directing said deluge over a glass. Anyways, I'm still left with a whack of foam, which is attractive enough in its menacingly frothy and bubbly manner, I suppose, but bottle conditioning was not part of the deal, I thought. It's going to be a while, so I best go hit the loo. All right, back now, and this one smells of chalky Flintstones vitamins, citrusy and faintly piney hops, grainy caramel malt, a tiny earthy and funky yeastiness, herbal tincture, and a tame stone fruit orchard fruitiness. The taste is gritty and grainy caramel malt, a waning flinty chalk character, wet dark bread, orange zest, faint leafy pinecone notes, a hint of candied lemon, and some further unchecked herbal and weedy hoppiness. The bubbles, as already established, are quite pervasive, and on the palate they manifest in a tightly-held fizziness, the body on the light side of medium weight, and so-so smooth, the carbonation and hops just a bit too clumsy hereabouts. It finishes off-dry, but barely, as the malt starts to show its cracks in the face of the various side players, who find power in collectivism. A decent enough showcase for this venerable American hop, too bad this Dutch concoction screws up the presentation side of things, which is either a quality control issue, or a cultural gap, hard to say here. At any rate, this tastes good, even if the name (being Dutch) reminds me of 'Afrikaans', which means absolutely nothing.",2014-12-29,43289,Licht & Lustig

Lots of grapefruit and pine with hints of orange and lemon and a bit of green tea. The sweet caramel malt is there and adds a measure of balance, but has trouble standing up to the hops. Definitely seems like more than 30 IBU's. The mouthfeel is really sharp and tangy with a somewhat fizzy but dry finish.

Malt presence is moderate and has a caramel sweetness. Yeast works its way through as well and might be the cause for the slight sharp edge that is perceived. At first, the taste is almost like that of grape fruit juice. A malty flavour follows that eventually leads up to a dry and pretty intense hop flavour. Yeast is defining as well and is constantly interwoven with the beer's texture, which is somewhat dull. Some more carbonation would be welcome.

A little sharp, clean, but very well fitted to go with the American hops.  Taste is balanced between hops and malt at the first sip. Mhh, bitternes is not very high and a little sharp. I would have expected this beer to be more bitter, but this is probably not ment to be an IPA. This brings me to it's body which is quite thin. At 4,5% ABV this is understandable, but it seems to take the beer out of balance. This leaves bitterness sharp and there is nothing else to support this bitterness. Malt is completely overpowered by the hoppy taste. Amarillo is a nice hop though. Bitterness is kicking in now halfway the glass.

The aftertaste got some chalk and minerals, brown malt, chocolate toffee and a slight metallic bitterness. The finish is almost burned with some metal and brown bread.

Fingers-width of tan/khaki head which gives way to a ring around the inside of the glass and a small amount of surface foam. Smell: Plenty of malt, as you'd expect from an English bitter, along with some dark fruit notes as well. The bottle blurb mentions 'hints of chocolate' but there's nothing like that evident in the smell, at least initially. Taste: There is a definite hint of dark chocolate in the taste, though, along with stewed, dark fruits. The whole thing tastes a bit like fruit cake with a hint of hops. There's plenty of maltiness - the grain bill mentions Maris Otter, Chocolate and Crystal malts and the only hop mentioned is Bramling Cross. Even so, this is as probably as 'traditional' as a bitter as you'll find. Feel: A bit lifeless - there's very little in the way of carbonation although it'd be unfair to describe it as completely flat. Even so, it's quite tasty and very drinkable and given the malt-forward nature the carbonation, or lack thereof, isn't really a dealbreaker.  Overall: Not bad, not bad at all - it's a bitter in the 'English' sense rather than the 'IPA' sense so if you're looking for a hop bomb then you're most definitely in the wrong place. However, if you're fancying a good, old-fashioned bitter then you can't go far wrong with this, but if you're after something with a stupendously complex flavour profile you're better off looking elsewhere.",2015-05-27,13084,Barnsey

Mouthfeel is smooth and full-bodied, with tingly carbonation and an astringency that leaves the palate dry. Aftertaste of fruity, bitter malt.

According to the label, the ingredients include Maris Otter, Chocolate and Amber malts, on top of Bramling Cross hops; it's fine filtered for bottling. A: pours a clear, dark russet brown hue, topped with a frothy dark beige head with superb retention, while carbonation comes mild and  S: caramelised apples, brown-sugary longan-fruit tea, black date paste, and a little stinky hay come on top of a super creamy and fragrant fruit-yeastiness, reminiscent of many ales by Adnams and Greene King, for some unknown reasons... raisiny, chocolatey notes of aromatic amber malts stay deeply underneath. Very aromatically malty overall. T: a mild sour-grapey edge along with black dates and cold sweet black tea surround the bitter-sweet, semi-sharp amber and (remotely) chocolatey malty theme, with a dry touch of burned malts and nuts at the back... the increasingly chewy and lengthy hop bitterness beautifully complements the lightly fruity aftertaste of dark malts, rendering an utterly soothing, bitter mouthfeel in the never-ending finish. M&amp;D: smooth on the palate with only a light dose of carbonation, this bottle version tastes cleaner and lighter than the cask version, which shows a bit more syrupy and oily mouthfeel. Although the body comes pretty light for the flavour, somehow it manages to hold up and supports the flavour equally well.

The flavors themselves are hard to discern at the individual level, blending together in a near-seamless complex of light caramel malt, popcorn, and bramble fruit, with almost a corn-like smooth sweetness and East Kent Goldings with the volume knob turned down. Fairly fizzy and thin bodied, just a hint of English pub chew with an uber-smooth mouthfeel. Finish is dryish and includes an interesting peanut butter taste that I get with the bottles as well. One could session this for decades and probably remain frustrated that you cannot taste more ... I suppose that's the whole idea here. What's there is indeed classic English bitter.

Slight floral character, with some subtle grassy hops in the finish, providing a gentle citrus twang.  T - Aroma translates poorly to the taste. Caramel malt is still present, but takes a backseat to the 2-row character. Fruity and hoppy twang from the aroma has been toned down a lot. Mild fruity flavor, adds some sweetness, and there's a sort of banana/clove thing going on that reminds me of a hefe. Overall this is too boring for my tastes, but still unoffensive. M - A little more than light-bodied, and the carbonation feels high without feeling at all fizzy.  D - A mild beer overall. The flavor profile just feel uninteresting and gives me little to enjoy.

It smells of sourdough bread, biscuity and grainy caramel and pale malts, a soft flintiness, and mild citrusy, grassy, and floral hops. The taste is very much consistent, with the biscuity and lightly doughy grainy caramel malt, the hard water character mostly washed away, and some tame citrusy, herbal hops rounding things out.  The carbonation is quite low, and unobtrusive, like I've got a draught pint here or something, the body medium weight, rather nice and smooth, and also a little watery, but not as much as I would expect for the 4.1% ABV. It finishes dry, ethereally hoppy, and bang-on for another swig.

3.29,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.0,3.5,"Bank's brewery pumps out more than 50 million pints each year and, indeed, their Bitter will look familiar; its clear complexion, butterscotch colour and almost tinsel-like gleam make for a generic, if good-looking ale. Its head leaves something to be desired but as someone who prefers their Bitter pulled from gravity cask I'm familiar with it looking a little flat.  At a modest 3.8% you wouldn't expect esters to be overly strong, but traces of dried fruits are noted. These aromas stop way short of fruitcake, though sweetly scented malt and its honeycomb hints play to that kind of confection. Naturally, a pungent, weedy quality accompanies closely.  A 'bitter' is, by definition, not sweet, but many (this one included) have a trace of toffee and nutty malt flavour. And their hoppiness may be prominent (relative to a 'mild') but it'll never be extreme. For Americans, this beer's earthy bitterness will hardly register. If anything it'll be the dried fruit notes and chalky water minerals that stand out most.  Its ""best before"", rather than listing a date some eight months in advance (these beers are generally afforded a year from the bottling date), really aught to read ""best enjoyed fresh and unfiltered on cask"". Were I doing that I assure you the scores posted would be much higher.  English Bitters, like a handful of styles (German Kölsch also comes to mind), are at their very best in the towns in which they're brewed. The closer to the source the better. In fact, they're rarely all that good at all without the atmospheric local surroundings - and certainly not when pasteurized and shipped halfway around the world. Here's my advice: unless a fresh cask - pass.",2014-11-22,27854,Banks's Bitter

The pour itself was more promising with a classic amber coloring and one-inch head...although the head disappeared rather quickly. I got a stale cardboard hops smell off the bat.

This theme of blandness continued through to the taste, a slight hint of bitter hops and nothing else. The mouthfeel wasn't bad for a beer, a medium mouthfeel with a bitter aftertaste did offer something else positive about the beer.

I have even mixed it with Mild, but still it will not excite me. It looks OK, light brown with a loose white head, which clings to the glass, and sometimes stays to the end.

Sorry I couldn't bring the scores up any, it is just a poor product from a very successful brewery.

3.12,2.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,"Murray's sweet dependable Murray's have been a bit of a standard-bearer for decent craft beer in Australia for a while now, and to be honest I'm surprised Punch &amp; Judy has thus far eluded review as it is a drop I've had at least once before. Time for me to right this... I wouldn't say 'wrong' and 'injustice' would be a bit melodramatic, let's say 'neutral' - time for me right this neutral! (has a good ring to it actually). Poured from a 330ml bottle into a nonic pint. A: Wow, do not shake this one up - hazy amber-brown bodied with a 2 inch white foamy head... also there is now beer on my kitchen floor... perhaps a bit on the fizzy side then. S: Nutty malt mixed with some caramel malts provide a hefty base for some floral and citric hops. Not bad but there is a bit of a tavern mop aroma mixed in as well (yes, I know what a tavern mop smells like, I have worked in taverns before). Bit of a mixed bag here. T: Flavour is as expected; nutty/caramel malts, floral/citric hops. Passionfruit makes a surprise appearance as well. There is a chemical aftertaste that one finds in Aussie macro lagers - like some sort of cleaning agent - not good. Aside from this the balance is alright, a bit on the boring side but that is always expected from a mid-strength. M: Mid to light bodied with that fizzy carbonation that was noted above in the exuberant head. D: Bit of an average brew from Murray's then. This ale has promise but is let down by the odd aftertaste, tavern mop aroma and ebullient carbonation. Feels like a missed opportunity for me as I quite enjoy the nutty flavoured brews, and this has nuts in spades. Also this is a mid-strength and my opinion of mid-strengths is 'why even bother' and at 3.9% ABV this brew does somewhat epitomise my opinion. Food match: Tavern stew is the first thing that sprung to mind, along with a crusty bread loaf, despite being a mid-strength there is a certain heartiness to this brew too.",2014-05-21,57877,Murray's Punch & Judy

Did buy a case direct upon its release, which I enjoyed similarly; but I don't think I ever reviewed it previously. Pours a caramel gold with really billowing and overdone head. Causes some issues with the initial pour. But does retain well with good lacing. Yeast chunks left in the bottle means this needs a bit of a mark down here though. Smell has the classic ""passionfruit"" NZ hop smell, and a more nutty hop aroma. There is faint toast and candy apple, and a malt presence too. Just great layers of flavour here. The NZ hops in this beer don't offend me like they've been known to. Taste is a beautifully balanced and subtle blending of hop and malt. Lots more candy apple flavours here and just great passionfruit flavours. Mouthfeel is a winning point too. Has hop bitterness and a hint of sweetness to help it down. Also it feels extremely refreshing and ""watery"" in a good way as it goes down. Overall just a fantastic beer. This is really what I always expected great English beer was supposed to taste like, although obviously the prominent NZ hops mean it's a little off-kilter. Fantastic beer and really shows Murray's to be a trendsetter. They were amongst the first in Australia making Barleywines and Imperial Stouts, and with this and Retro Rocket they're the first Australian brewer to do great things at the lower ABV spectrum. The quality of this beer cannot be understated. Its low ABV and big but delicate flavour make it perfect for a Sydney summer.",2013-01-12,57877,Murray's Punch & Judy

The aroma of this is quite good - lots of summery fruits - maybe some mango. Not overwhelming, but smells as though it is packed of hops. The taste is excellent, this beer is definitely not relying on alcohol for the taste, instead, great malty flavour combined with a good fruitiness definitely appeals to me. The mouthfeel is maybe a little overcarbonated, but not to the point where it is unpleasant - definitely not watery though.

Head is medium with small beige bubbles, retains a crown and leaves some pleasant trails of off-white foam. Nice-looking bitter. Nose is very hoppy, with a distinctly floral tinge. Fair malt backbone with hints of English toffee, but predominantly a nice fruity hop character with some resinous notes, a bit of pineapple and rosewater. Pleasant and enticing smell. Taste starts off sweet with a few notes of toffee and a nice barley flavour, hops come through not strongly, but distinctively, without a huge hit but a nice lingering presence from the mid to the back. They're quite floral in nature with some herbal notes and hints of mint, passionfruit and a slight medicinal character on the back. Not outrageously robust, but a lot of flavour for a milder beer and a lot to like. Feel is light and fluid with a little bit of a harsh sizzle as it goes down. But a very nice body for how light it is. Trust Murray's to brew a lighter beer well. A balanced, tasty beer without all the bells and whistles.",2010-04-28,57877,Murray's Punch & Judy

It's reasonably light, but quite pleasant and true to style. Light malt again, and a nice resiny hop character to keep it from becoming overpowerrjng. Some butterscotch through the centre, before a clean and single-minded bitterness sweeps through to clear it out at the end. Mouthfeel could use a cask conditioning - a smooth lack of carbonation would fit well. As it is, it feels too light and sparkly. A lot of character for such a session-strength brew, but it all stays tight not to overwhelm the palate.

Zero aspects for me stands out as unwanted or unbalanced. This would make a lovely refreshing beer especially in warmer months. O- Understated elegance for those who appreciate quality, and wish to take it a bit more gently once in a while. Very nice, I'd buy it again in the latter circumstances. p.s. I've rated the beer as I found it, but writing this I realise the inclination (at times) to up-rate drama in a beer. Higher ABV% tends to provide a foundation for such drama, as does being mega over-hopped for hop-heads.

A: Poured into a tulip pint glass. A rich orange-amber colour with some floating sediment and medium carbonation. Forms a large head of white foam that lasts for a minute or two before collapsing to a patchy surface layer. Faint lacing.

S: Aroma of light malt with hints of fruity ale yeast, faint grain, hay and subtle stewed leaves.

T: Tastes of light malt with a dry finish. Notes of fruity ale yeast, faint husky grain, grass/hay, stewed leaves and a twinge of cardboard. Well-attenuated, followed by a mild bitterness upon swallowing.

M: Mouthfeel is smooth, tingly and dry, with spritzy carbonation and a light, insubstantial body.

O: Meh - a bit of a non-event. Looks OKish, while the aroma and flavour are light and short on substance. Weak malt and yeast esters. Thin body, though it suits the style. A typical mass-produced SN brew; bland and characterless. No need to seek it out.",2014-09-09,106722,Whitstable Bay Pale Ale

Forms a small head of frothy off-white foam that lasts for a minute or two before reducing to a decent surface layer. A slightly sweet, fruity aroma with notes of roasted malt, butterscotch and non-descript leafy hops. Not a great combination - it doesn't smell terribly pleasing. Tastes of caramel malt with a mild bitter finish. Notes of toffee/caramel and butterscotch blended with a vague fruitiness that's hard to pin down - possibly from the yeast. Also faint aromatic hops and stewed hop bitterness. An unpleasant background hint of stewed veg. Mouthfeel is smooth and tingly but watery; an astringent element dries the palate. Aftertaste of bitter stewed leaves and veg. Poor - not a nice ale. The aroma/flavour combo is pretty unpleasant; stewed hops and fruity yeast don't mix.

Sadly, no lacing or staying power... which means no foaming agents within. Aromas are velvety and complex with a spicy honey malt signature up front leading to mild ripened peach notes and a balancing dose of leafy hops in the finish. The whole is fragrant but not overdone allowing for the possibility of a very sessionable beer. Flavours are not nearly as complex as the aromas and lack the depth and smoothness as well. Bone dry as it enters the mouth it yields a grainy metallic taste up front and leads almost immediately to an astringent bitterness with barely any malt or fruitiness expressing themselves.

2.81,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,"IIt's a really hot and humid day so I'm serving this nice and cold. This is the same brewer that does Bishop's Fingers so I was afraid that this brew would be overly sweet for my palate and it is. I do like the colour a deep copper/gold, but the head is thin and snappy. That means the bubbles pop to soon in my lingo. It smells too malty, and for a beer that calls itself a ""Summer Hop Ale"" there isn't much of a hop smell to this. At least not the hops I like. The taste is far too sweet for me. I don't like sweet in my beer.If that's a characteristic you enjoy your going to appreciate this more than me.

Slightly oaty, grassy, plenty of honey notes. Quite lovely. A great job with the aromatic hops Unfrotunately that lovely aroma would be the high point. Taste is much less interesting, and mouthfeel offers little stimulation. More bitterness could be a good thing. Seems to be a light soapy feature. Flavour falls short of interesting, being largely one-dimensional and this beer's coarse water - which I don't mind (in fact, usually enjoy with British ales) - seems to overrun the hops and flavour.

Aroma is pungent perfumey floral peach-like hops over a solid biscuit malt grainyness. Solid malt spine, medium-light body,.... sticky, mineral mouth feel, rounded mellow fruity character. Up front you get modest sweetness which turns to a definate buscuit maltiness, this becomes balanced midway with the hop mixture which creates a wonderful peach-grapefuit decernment that compliments the detectable fruity phenols of the ale yeast and rides just above the sweet biscuit maltiness....giving balance and a light fruity-hoppy bias. The Finsh is long and slowly bittering as the biscuit malt is slowly overtaken by light ( not unpleasant) metallic bittering. Light, peach-lile hopiness, biscuity, satisfying, mellow and drinkable. I'm not usually a fan of the English mild or light bitter ales but, as they go, this is one of the tastiest ones I've ever sampled with a rounded mellow quality....this tastes like it was conditioned long enough to remove the sharp edges short cycle ales are prone to....gives it great drinkability and makes it a good choice for a session ale.",2006-07-08,8082,Goldings

The taste is mild with creamy notes of semi-sweet malt (with a little hint of burned notes), but the focus is on the aromatic hops. I found flavours of butter, camomile, pistachio nuts.

A bright golden-yellow colour with slight haze and medium carbonation. Forms a large head of white foam that lasts for a few minutes before disappearing. Aroma of grainy malt with hints of earthy yeast, grass and faint stewed hops. Unexciting but balanced. Tastes of light, grainy malt with a dry finish. Notes of grain, earthy yeast, mild grass, faint stewed hops and a hint of cardboard in the background. Well-attenuated, with a subtle bitterness upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth, dry and tingly, with pleasant carbonation and decent body. Aftertaste of mild earthy yeast and faint grain. A rather bland ale, though not unpleasant.

Both the taste and mouthfeel are very refreshing. The carbonation is crisp and clean with a nice bite. Taste is on the hoppy side of things--especially for an English bitter.

At 4.8%abv., bottle-conditioned in a brown glass bottle; BB 31/03/09, served cool in a straight imperial pint glass. A: pours a light golden hue, the fluffy white head settles fast to a rim, on top of very light carbonation. S: a mild aroma of lemon rind and melon comes with floral notes, a little mineral and a faint eggy edge of sulphur.  T: lightly citric and bitter-sweet foretaste, skirted by a touch of salt, sulphur, and mildly-flavoured but deep pale malts; slowly the zesty fruity hops prevail, brining more moderate bitterness of hops to enjoy. The overall taste is, to me, more like a mild German pils even. M&amp;D: to my best recollection this ale is somewhat different from the previous Kew Brew, which shows a more complex composition and aromatic flavour profile.

Hoppy with the same grapefruit and bitterness from the nose along with some citrus and floral flavours. Bread &amp; biscuit with a malty bitterness follow. English in style, bitter and with fruity undertones. Medium bodied with a great balance between flavours and moderate carbonation. There is some sweetness initially with a semi-bitter taste.

The taste is rich, dense and layered. Complex. When colder, the hops are subdued and the malt mild. As it warms, the malts grow sweeter and more pronounced as the hops are stronger, more astringent, and flowery. The British hops never overpower, but this beer is a showcase for me for presenting them in all their glory. The organic grains, hops, and careful brewing are evident and appreciated, bringing depth and complexity of flavor. Beautifully done, Black Isle! Excellent session beer. The label clearly calls this an IPA, and at that it is well within the lighter alcohol British IPA style, and a standout at that. Excellent beer with deep, rich flavors.

Some yeast notes but mostly clean. The taste is a bit more delicate than the nose would indicate. A light grainy and malty base with a nice sweetness but a bit light overall. Some fruity notes with figs and a touch of raisins but there is a more white wine taste that really comes out and lingers. Some herbal and lavender notes enhance this.

Gooey lacing abounds, much like a good pale ale or IPA.  Smell- Floral, almost like a honeysuckle... the Magnum and Mt. Hood hop varieties lend a juicy nose and whet the palate for the first sip. A classic, English malt nose comes through as well, and the overall aroma is well balanced. Taste- A touch of biscuit complements the rich, smooth hops that dominate the flavor profile. Wickedly bitter in the finish, it is a cross between a bitter and an IPA to me. The lingering, drying hop afterburn is everlasting and almost too strong for a session beer such as this. The bold, expressive character is noteworthy. Mouthfeel/Drinkability- As perfect as perfect could be, the texture in the mouth is simply sublime.

This beer poured a muddy-amber color, with some dark gold highlights when held to the light. A modest, off-white head perched atop the beer for about a minute, then receeded to a foam collar. Spartan, spotty lace.  The nose is very, very malty. Too malty, really, along with some overly assertive diacetyl notes. It reminded me of a 2nd tier amber ale, all sweetness, no hops, making the photograph on the label depicting hop harvesting a century ago rather ironic.  The taste is somewhere between fairly malty and malt bomb. The maltiness is way out of whack for the style, and too much for any more than a pint. There's a very mild hoppy dryness way in the background, but it doesn't come near to balancing this.  This is a beer with low carbonation, not out of character for the style, but it's a little too much body to be right.  Not a horrible beer, but nothing worth seeking out ever again, either.

Thin, sudsy lace sticks without conviction to the upper third of the glass and will surely be washed away as I drink. As it turns out, the glass coverage is more impressive that I initially gave it credit for. A good bit of attractive lace decorates the glass as the beer falls and rises, falls and rises. The nose smells more like pale malt than caramel malt, which is what was actually used. Orange and lemon fruity hops are dominant, yet the beer doesn't smell all that hoppy. There's no real pungency, nothing to get my hop radar pinging. On the palate, caramel malt is much more noticeable. The flavor is more hoppy than the nose, although not by a large margin, and there's just enough bitterness that the name isn't wishful thinking. White grapefruit is now making a valued contribution. The flavor seems a little too subdued at first, but the hop bitterness is asserting itself more and more as I get deeper into the glass. Maybe I've been drinking too many IPAs lately and need to throttle back my expectations. The medium length finish is exceptionally clean and the mouthfeel is smack dab medium with an enlivening amount of carbonation. Dick's Best Bitter grew on me over the course of the bottle. It isn't a 'wow' kind of beer right out of the hopper, but give it a chance and it may win you over like it did me.

There is a strong malt character in there, but this has a definite fruity, grassy scent to it. The taste is slightly sour, but still with a brown sugar malt flavour.

3.57,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,"Had to venture into Jenners to grab this, but there it was on the shelf, a raven on the front matching the raven from the Orkney insignia. Not at all a common beer in most parts of the world, worth grabbing if you see it. Nothing to get excited about the appearance. Basically a dark golden, maybe slightly amber, with a reddish tint. Head is large and bubbly, breaking down quickly into a thin lace against the edge with little floating bits of lace in the center. Nose is nice, fairly floral at first, which is a bit of a suprise, given that this is from a Scottish brewery. Nice to see someone doing something a bit different. Definite hints of apple and plums or something like that. Certainly some maltiness underlying the scent, slightly sweet and bready. The illusion of a fruity nose disappears with the first sip. This brew is primarily dominated by the malts. The hops make an appearance at the end, but it is muted, not strong enough to leave more than a lingering faint bitterness, quickly overwhelmed by the outside world. Not a beer that sits in the mouth well. The malts are mostly sweet, not harsh on any particular characteristic, and it works well for a pale ale, although used as I am to West Coast ales, I guess I expect a bit more hops. But this does work fairly well. The closest American analogies I can think of come from different styles, but thats ok, in the end this is an ok but not exceptional drink. The mouthfeel is pretty standard, moderate amount of carbonation, although it feels a bit weak and thin. I'm sure that in a cask it would be considerably better, with a much smoother mellower feel, but I suspect the actual thinness would remain. Taking pale ale as a light hoppy style when brewed in Scotland, I would say this is to be expected. The drinkability is alright though, particularly as the alocohol is low. The absence of alcohol doesn't seem to affect the taste much, and it does mean that a few more pints of this could be put down.

Tastes of sweet, dark malt with a mild bitter finish. Notes of caramel/toffee, roasted grain, yeast, stewed hop bitterness accompanied by subtle hints of coffee and cocoa. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and smooth; almost velvety. Slight tingling from the carbonation. Aftertaste of bitter dark malt - a little harsh. Slides down rather nicely. The body is especially good, but the character is malty and easy-going, with a subtle blend of flavours. Well worth your time if you come across it.",2011-11-17,49413,Adnams Gunhill

Lots of toffee and caramel with some nuttiness and hints of dark fruit and tea with a very subdued hop profile and a smidgen of chocolate.

S – Toffee crystal malt dominates the initial aroma with some subtle bready malt coming through. Light marmalade fruit character sneaks in to provide some hop notes. T – Much like the smell; toffee with some bready malt along with a very slight hint of chocolate. The marmalade fruit flavours play a very minor supporting role. M – Lighter side of medium bodied with a low carbonation and present yet well balanced bitterness. O – Would prefer if some more hop character came through but still a tasty English ale.,2011-04-27,49413,Adnams Gunhill

Teak wood red/brown colour, clear and clean. On top sat a thick off-white foaming head which left some good lacing as I downed the beer. Malts are the main aroma producing elements of the nose producing a toffee, molasses and roasted feel to the smell. Sharper than I anticipated, the malts from the aroma also dominate the flavours somewhat, the roasted malts being the most prominent taste.

3.75,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,"Purchased at the Tesco supermarket, coming in a 500ml brown bottle, filtered and pasteurised. BB 09/03/2010, served cool in a straight imperial pint glass. NOTE: this beer has joined the ""fight against Prostate Cancer"" by contributing a donation from Gunhill sales to ""The Prostate Cancer Charity"". A: pours a reddish, light copper hue with good clarity and moderate fizz (medium-size bubbles), topped with a fairly frothy, well-lasting off-white head. S: smells like Adnams' Bitter with an extra touch of fruitiness - the typical earthy/muddy (Fuggles?) hops and Styrian Golding-like spicy fruits are joined by toasted apple-slice, lemon-zest, with a hint of toffee-nuts and sweet black tea. Refreshing, hoppy, on a par with a good body of amber/crystal malts. T: the mildly sweet amber malts with the unique touch of Adnams' yeastiness are laced by a mild tinge of earthy hops, then sweet black tea, caramelised plums, and light-flavoured nutty and aromatic, lightly-roasted malts develop at the back, with a wee smoky touch even, where the palate turns dry-ish with a good deal of dried hops to linger in the end, at a just moderate level of bitterness. A smooth, integrated flavour profile is demonstrated overall. M&amp;D: the carbonation comes sli...ghtly higher than necessary, although this is the common feature of all Adnams' ales in the bottle form and the body of this ale is able to carry the thin, fizzy façade. Overall, I find this a pretty balanced ale - a good aromatic malt backbone is balanced with traditional aromatic hoppiness with a necessary sour edge throughout the drink. BTW, this ale is also available on cask during the JDW's festival recently, but I failed to catch it in time at my local pub. I really hope that Adnams could try to put this on cask as a regular seasonal? It does have good potentials for a good sale on cask.",2009-04-26,49413,Adnams Gunhill

Little Barley Bitter really shines on the tongue &amp; in the unreal drinkability. Light malty sweetness, earthy hops, a graininess right out of an American flag commercial.

3.95,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,"Each style of beer, like our own genetics, is built on a plan coded by genes (which, for beer, could be considered the ingredients: malts, hops, etc). The nature and ratio of those ingredients (mineral content in the water, the characteristics of different yeasts, etc) determine everything that define the beer - how it looks, smells, tastes, etc.  But each recipe is liable to change every time it's copied. These slight variations distinguish one country or region's brewing traditions from the other, allow for creative interpretation and, again like our own genetics, increase the chances of survival by distinguishing itself for natural selection (which, in this case, means being selected off the shelf).  Adding copious amounts of fruity, piny hops to traditional styles is one such change to beer's ""genes"", and is part of a new movement that rules in many places, the United States first and foremost, although other countries around the world now too. It has yet to *really* catch on in Canada, but it seems to have in Squamish, British Columbia.  Pink, fruity bubblegum, gooey pine serum and spruce tips are sure indicators. These notes are present not only in smell but in taste as well. Accompanied by toffee and rich malts they make for a flavour that is so big it spills over into the mouthfeel, with sharp acidity and caramel sweetness sweeping over the palate like windshield wipers. The more I drink the more I like this beer. I readily accepted its light copper colour and puffy head as attractive, but only now can I see the allurement of its intricate lacing. I wouldn't mind the entire 1 liter bottle to myself and only wish I could go back to the store for another. If I were Howe Sound I'd consider this as a possible flagship brand.  Bailout Bitter and this brewery's Devil's Elbow IPA are clearly cousins under the skin. Both are emphatically hoppy variations on classic English styles and point to a new, exciting, far more brazen character of Canadian brewing. These 'genetic mutations' inevitably give them an inherent advantage to traditional (read: less characterful, more mundane) offerings.",2010-11-15,46698,Bailout Bitter

There's some pine, a little diacetyl, fruity esters...they're there, just sniff harder. The northwest hops are noticable in this bitter. It's a well structured beer, balanced between the malt and hops. Lemongrass, hints of citrus, floral, a little diacetyl and hop bitterness that stick to the palate and linger.

Candy-like fruitiness - orange marmalade from the hops and juicy-fruit from yeasty esters. Mouthfeel is medium full, and slightly sticky. Seems like this one was mashed warm and fermented with a relatively low attenuation yeast. Drinkability is pretty good. Tasty and satisfying.

If a true ESB is about balance then this is a very nice attempt, especially after the beer warms a bit and let's the toasty bready malt come through. True to form, hops, in this case closer to west coast cascade, add a nice cleansing effect. Finish is slightly dry, but not to the point of puckering. Almost perfect mouthfeel, carbonation is bang on. Smooth, refreshing. Not to slick, not too much bite. Goldilocks would say just right.

4.2,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,"Now and again a beer comes along that you feel you could settle down with for good. Fill a liter-sized sippy cup with Bailout Bitter and wheel me off to the retirement home, please.  Gimmicky the label is, but it made me chuckle and buy a bottle out of curiosity's sake. And truth be told I've always been attracted to beers that come in vessels bigger than my head. Though Bailout comes with a Grolsh-esque reusable stopper, I've yet to actually use it - and neither will you. It pours light for a bitter, but my idea of bitter is forever tainted by the murky-brown pints of John Smith's and Webster's ubiquitous to British pubs in the 90s. Bailout is a frosted, honeyed gold, with a lively effervescence as it slides into the pint glass.  The aroma hits with a fresh blast of yeast and hops, zesty and uncomplicated. Upon raising the glass hints of hefeweizen-style citrus burst under your nose.  The beer is immediately refreshing. It is tartly bitter yet clean, with perfectly judged hops for its modest strength. The body is round enough to be pleasing, yet never bold or committal. Its biggest charm is its ability to enliven at every sip and never grow tiresome. While not a great beer in the sense of having unmistakable character, this is comfort-brewing at its best. For me, cracking one open is like putting Goodfellas into the DVD player, or opening a worn Bukowski novel. A reliably brilliant experience.",2009-11-17,46698,Bailout Bitter

Now that they're available here, I have no such problem indulging their somewhat amusing endeavor... This beer pours a clear, light golden colour, with a fair amount of soapy white head, which leaves some sparse lace as it takes its time melting away. It smells of crisp biscuit grain, and mild floral hops. The taste is more biscuit grain, and earthy, grassy hops.

4.45,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,"1 litre bottle, beer brewed as a gimmick for the global recession. Appearance: Bright, transparent, golden colour with three finger white head when poured into 500ml tall central European style glass tankard, receding to heavy ring and thin layer of froth with good lacing. Aroma: Lots of hops, satsumas, subtle alcoholic warmth. Taste: What exactly is a golden bitter brewed in the pacific northwest? Answer: basically a very hoppy golden pale ale or smoother version of an IPA. I haven't come across any other golden bitters before, and this tastes nothing like any bitter I have had. I'm not sure that calling this a bitter is correct; but then Howe Sound already have a hoppy pale ale. All this aside, this is a tasty beer. Crisp, hoppy, fruitiness that you would expect from an IPA, but something is slightly different about the flavour in this beer. A hint of blonde ale and pilsner flavours, a lingering but not overpowering finish from the hops; and also a malty aspect that you might expect from a good central European pilsner, while still tasting like top-fermented ale. Curious beer, but interesting and very tasty. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, crisp. Drinkability: Certainly drinkable, rewarding from the hops and balance of the beer, while leaving you wondering - what style is this? Nevertheless, it's good.",2009-04-24,46698,Bailout Bitter

Backing that is a good shot of citrusy hops. Bitter, but not overpoweringly so. The malt flavours are quite subdued, but I like this. The hops really are king here. Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is relatively thin, but I wouldn't use nasty adjectives like watery or insubstantial. Very pleasant to drink.  Drinkability: This is a GREAT session beer. It has all the qualities of good beer, but doesn't overwhelm me. Both refreshing and delicious.  Overall: What a nice bitter!

The hops really dominate on this, but there still is a very strong bready nose to it. Rich fresh-bread and bitter hop flavour. Ranks right up there with Anderson Valley and Fullers ESBs.

Okay aromas with solid balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, earthy hop, and fruity yeast ester notes; with decent strength. A bit too fruity, but has some solid malt presence. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pear/apple, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pear/apple, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of dark/bready malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. I swirled out most of the overcarbonation; which lead to a medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is good.

3.39,3.75,3.5,3.5,2.75,3.25,"I picked up a bottle of Round Barn Brewery's Bob's Your Uncle a couple days ago for $1.75 at Boyne Country Provisions. I've never tried anything from his brewery since they aren't really aren't available in my area, but I'm always down to try a new Michigan brewery and I thought I would start off with their ESB, so lets see how it goes. No visible bottling date. Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into an imperial pint glass. A- The label is pretty simple and it makes it pretty well known that this is an English style beer, the names a little weird, but at least there's an explanation to it. It poured a murky orange/amber color that took on more of a brighter amber color when held to the light with three fingers worth of off white head that died down to a thin layer that stayed till the end and left a little bit of patchy lacing behind. This was a nice looking beer, I have no complaints.  S- The aroma starts off with a medium amount of sweetness followed by a good amount of malts that impart some nice caramel and toasted malt aromas. Up next comes a slight plastic like aroma followed by some typical English hops that impart some earthy and herbal hop aromas.This beer had a nice aroma with some good balance, but the slight plastic aroma threw me off a little. T- The taste seems to be similar to the aroma and it starts off with a good amount of malts that impart some lightly toasted and caramel malt flavors. Up next comes the hops which are those same typical English hops that I got in the aroma, but this time it's the earthy hop aspect that seems to stick out the most imparting a medium amount of bitterness with a malty and earthy hop aftertaste. This was a nice tasting beer and I think it's pretty true to style. M- Smooth, clean, crisp, on the lighter side of being medium bodied with a higher amount of carbonation that's a little too high and prickly. The mouthfeel wasn't bad, but the high prickly carbonation really hurt it. Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a fairly true example of the style, it had a couple of issues but other than that it fit into the style nicely. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, clean, not filling and the flavor did a nice job at holding my attention, I could drink a few of these but the high carbonation might start to wear on me. What I liked the most about this beer was the balance, the taste and aroma seemed pretty well balanced. What I like the least about this beer was the carbonation, it was just to high and prickly. I don't really buy this style often, but I wouldn't rule out ordering it at a bar if it was available. I would recommend it to people who like the style. All in all this beer wasn't bad and it does a nice job at representing the style. This made for a decent first impression for Round Barn Brewery, I'll have to keep an eye out for more of their beers, nice work guys.",2013-10-09,73689,Bob's Your Uncle
2.96,2.25,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,"Bob's Your Uncle has far more head than it should given the cautious angle from which it was poured; in the time I looked away to type this sentence it had already begun to spill over the top of my imperial pint glass (note: those are 568ml, the bottle is 330ml). My computer top says thanks. This cloudy, bubbly, orange-amber beer is also polluted with clumps of sediment.  It's hard to note much aroma given the mattress of head that stands between the liquid and my nostrils; this foam is thick enough to be a nightclub bouncer. As result, very little of the malt's sweet, subtly toffee-like breadiness can be appreciated (nor the grassy hops I think might have been detected). Instead, we are treated to a tutorial on yeasty phenols and esters.  Indeed, had I opened this bottle with the intention of making bread, there would have been no surprises and I'd have been quite happy. But alas I did not - I wanted a malty, sessionable ale after a long night's work - and this liquid yeast sample doesn't exactly quench thirst like your typical pint of plain; it is phenolic (spicy), a bit boozy, and dry as eczema.  The yeast may appear to settle down but every sip brings a fresh rush of peppery yeast phenols to the palate. The beer is muted of its malt and hop features - it is neither sweet nor bitter, really - and beyond tastes of white bread and spiced, overripe apples, there's little else to write about. It may have a Union Jack on the label but this beer tastes distinctly Belgian.  I have a strict rule about reviewing infected beer, or any beer suspected to not be at its best. But I also have feelings - and when I brave inclement weather and American customs and drive 5 hours to eagerly spend my hard-earned money on a little known regional brewery that's new to me instead of the other, world-class offerings on the shelf - many of which are my all-time favourites - I feel a little frustrated.

It does keep some, eventually some fairly heavy islands in the middle and a full sort of foam at the edges. Lacing is left lightly and spottily on the sides of the glass. The aroma features some nicely sturdy malts, English varietals offering lightly metallic and fruity notes with a light earthiness. Still metallic and earthy, the flavor features mostly the fruity note, while a mildly herbal note sneaks into the finish. Some grains also pull through. The body reaches medium. There's not so much carbonation as straight-up crispness, but it takes a spritzy tone. Some smoothness becomes more of a filling foaminess.",2013-08-19,73689,Bob's Your Uncle

3.48,4.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0,"Colour me underwhelmed by this one. Drank from the cask on tow occasions, once in Dartmoor, and once not far from Evesham.  Rich amber pour with a finger of well-lacing white head. Faint fruit in the nose, with a lot of grainy malt. The flavour is one-dimensional, relying heavily on the aforementioned grainy malts and a heightened tannin bitterness from the hops. A touch of fruit, perhaps, but little else. This makes it passable, but far from perfect. A nice mouthfeel helps to redeem, as the cask has given this an interesting texture, while the low ABV enhances the sessionability. Why would you session it though?",2009-09-09,13926,Butcombe Bitter
4.35,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer was on cask at my overnight accommodation this week, really glad I choose to stay at 'The Lamb Inn', Iron Acton.  Poured a lovely deep, dark amber, clear, wholesome and smooth looking. One of the whitest of white heads I've ever seen on a bitter, it was only thin, but it stayed and left some lacing as the beer level sank. I had three pints and loved each one, the hops and barley aroma was slightly sulphurus but not off-putting in any way, it just added to the bitterness that came towards the finish of each mouthful. It is a true flavoursome English Bitter and was the only beer the brewery produced for its first 18 years, they now do three others. Very moorish, which is why I had three of these and didn't get to try the others, which were also on offer, along with Bass and Courage Bitter (all on cask!).",2009-09-03,13926,Butcombe Bitter

S: apple-ish fruity hops along with deeply earthy and hay-ish smell of Fuggles-hops, a stream of light maltiness stays underneath--simple, but nice and focused. T: lovely maltiness with a deeply toffee-ish hint prevails upfront, quite chewy; a profound tea-ish hoppyness joined by a faint trace of leafy bitterness lingers in the long aftertaste, where an intriguingly crisp and bitter finish deep on the sides of the tongue brings a LOT of pleasure and soothness~~ M&amp;D: very fresh, softly carbonated, and medium-bodied; this is the kind of good honest cask bitter which could wake up the taste buds and make them shout for more~~ A session ale for me.",2006-05-06,13926,Butcombe Bitter

This is super watery and incredibly bland. There's just a little bit floral hops, and *maybe* just a smidge of biscuity malt, but there's just basically nothing here. Completely forgettable.

4.03,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Served hand-pulled at The Harp in London in an imperial pint glass. A - Classic bitter; slighty cloudy amber, filled to the rim with just the thinnest of lacing on the top. S - Again classic bitter balance of malt and hops off the nose. T - A bit thinner than I was expecting, to be honest. The malt is up front with nice caramel flavor and a bit of diacetyl, however there was a bit less hop character then I'm used to, and I say that with the English bitter category in mind (i.e., NOT the IPA category). The balance between malt and hops is ""delicate"", with maltiness coming out a bit on top; had that balance been tilted just a bit the other way this beer would be nearly perfect.  M - Nice body, and obviously being hand-pulled, it's nearly all from the beer and not the carbonation. I love this style of beer, and this is a very good example but this came up just a BIT short for me overall. Just a bit more English bitter-style hoppiness (see: DarkStar HopHead for example) would have put this over the top.

Finish is dry and very more-ish..  A real mouth-filler. Big bodied for the style and so round and smooth.  Obviously painfully drinkable.

Poured a great pint with a decent head, good lacing. Nice malty smell with some floral hops lingering in there, too. And the taste was excellent. I don't think I've had any beer that so perfectly matched the hops-to-malt ratio one would expect for the style. Yeah, it's a bitter, so the hops aren't overpowering in the least, but they're noticeable and they mesh very well.  Mouthfeel was good, not as flat as I was expecting. And drinkability?

Appearance is relatively typical for a cask English bitter. Deep reddish-brown in color with very little head. Since it's cask, there's no nitro, and it's pulled from traditional hand-drawn pumps, so only a 1/2-finger head emerges. The color though is quite lovely. Although this is a traditional bitter, the taste was much sweeter in my opinion. Can't quite place the exact flavors, but there was a floral/fruity sweetness on the finish with very faint flavors and nut and cinnamon as well--but these are very subtle.

The nose was challenging yet welcoming--a smell of earthiness and culture. The taste overrides the nose with a surprising crispness--a wave of clean, pleasant hoppiness, accompanied by a slight tang, washing over the palate. It is a flavor of hearty golden ale with a light bitter citrus. It creates sceneries of an English coal-mining town and a beach resort. This beer is light at heart yet heavy with history, just like its gravityeasy-drinking yet dense.

Sitting for a few minutes, it starts to become a little tangy/citrusy?. Grapefruit begins to show itself as it warms. Very enjoyable. This was drank at My Place as of 1/8/06 out of a pint glass.

3.7,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,"It's not hard to like Mac's; a brewery based in Nelson NZ that follows the strict German ""Reinheitsgebot"" (or ""purity law"") and tries to give their beers an interesting kiwi hop spin to their beers (which generally include the fantastic ""cascade"" hop to boot!). I certainly enjoyed my last Mac's brew outing (in the form of the impressive Hop Rocker), and I suspect for a beer that proudly includes 5 different types of malt I will likewise enjoy this. Poured from a 330ml bottle into a conical pint... though the conical pint does look a little ""glass half-empty"" with only 330ml's in it. A: I'm awed by such a perfect clear sienna body and the mighty 2cm chalk white head that sticks around longer than expected before leaving a healthy lace inside my glass. Top marks here. S: The aroma has a decent caramel malt base mixed in with a biscuit accent and golden syrup sweetness. It's definitely no slouch with the hops either - I can detect an earthy slightly citrus hop nose, which is quite welcome in my books. T: Damn this is close to a decent English bitter! The caramel malts are up front with a mid to back palate bitterness throughout and an earthy (even nutty) tone is present. There is very little of the sweetness I was expecting in the nose. The flavour is good but not great - the bitterness of the hops is too present for this style, it needed to be easier on the bitterness (despite being called English bitter the style itself is far from it).  M: Low to mid carbonation as an English style brew should be. The body is also on par being medium-bodied. D: I want to like this beer more because it ticks all the boxes of being a great ale; all except that present bitter note in the palate, which is really holding this beer from being a real classic drop. Otherwise it's a good brew for the price (when it's on special that is), and it goes down fairly well. Food match: My food match for this beer is light stews/casseroles or roast lamb, veggies and gravy (or mint sauce).

Contrasting this is a peppery/spicy hop flavour sneaking around somewhere in the background.  M - Again loads of malt which coats the mouth but otherwise not much happening - minimal carbonation.

Poured into goblet glasses a dark amber red with a dense foamy off white head that dissipated slowly into a 5mm foam. Looked good, nice and bright working well. Aroma: What can I say but: hops! Hops! Hops! Big pungent, citric, aromatic, peachy hops! I'd say they're Amarillo, reminded me of a less chunky version of JS Speculator or Golden ale. Booya! Taste: A tad thin, but malty, biscuity, hoppy, nicely bitter, not overly so, and finishes with a slightly burnt toffee. Great dark malt flavours, dry on the tongue, long lasting malty finish. The aromas are awesome, but it seems to belie the flavour. I expected a bigger bitterness in the flavour, but instead I was very pleasantly suprised.

Overall I did not like this beer as much as some of Mac's other offerings which I find a bit odd considering that it must have been popular at the brewpub for Lion (who currently own the rights to marketting Macs beers) to produce it on a large scale.",2005-04-17,23210,Sassy Red

JSB has smooth, creamy feel with of course that 'taste of Yorkshire' praised by the great Winston Churchill himself. Its delightful golden colour can be likened to piss although its taste is the exact opposite (not shit - see review on Guiness). The alcohol percentage of 3.8% is ideal and complements the taste like no other alcohol percentage. All in all, JSB is the Pint of Champions. We fucking love John Smith's Bitter.

2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,"I bought this beer in Germany along with a trusty Newcastle as an escape from the many German pilseners that dominate the German beer market. Boy, what a mistake. Initially I was all for the beer, as it poured a nice dark amber/brown color with a nice, thick, off-white head. Smell was somewhat floral and grassy, nothing amazing, but nothing bad, either. The Germans I was dining with didn't particularly seen to enjoy the fragrance, though. I should've taken that as a sign. As soon as I put the beer into my mouth, I couldn't believe the disappointment. The sweet malt character did not meld well with the bitterness at all, and the overall taste was nothing less than rotting vegetables. I wasn't even able to finish the beer. Perhaps I just got a bad batch, or the can killed it, or my taste buds just weren't adjusted to it after so many German pilseners. That seems unlikely, though, as I had also been enjoying Altbier, Weizenbier, Doppelbock, Schwarzbier, and even more styles during a stint in Scandanavia.

Light caramel malts with mild toastiness up front segues into a solid bitterness midway through the sip that carries through to the ending. As the beer warms it manages to sweeten a bit. Mouthfeel is good. It's got a nice thickness with soft carbonation. Drinkability is very good. I finished the first glass quickly and could easily have a few more.

It had a nice blend of hops and malt and the beer was smooth, one of the smoothest beers that I have ever tried, and creamy, but I did find that it was slightly watered down, just ever so slightly.

An always dependable brew, it starts with an inch thick head, spongy with a high retention, that settles into copper clarity. The lacing is minimal with a low clingage rate (Is ""clingage"" a word?)  The nose allows some fruity ester while the taste borders on sweet clove and minor hoppiness - though it is described as being dry-hopped. Hmmm?  The mouthfeel is not a complex one and is rather unbalanced and nondescript. All in all, a pleasant beer that requires nothing of your palate.

Smell: The hop aroma is much more apparent in the fresh version, presenting a dirty, earthy aroma that screams euro hops. Taste: The malts provide a biscuity flavor that pairs well with the reserved hop aroma. The hops leave a earthy flavor (as opposed to citrus or pine) in the mouth. The malts are present just enough to counteract the hops, giving the ale a well-balanced finish. Mouthfeel: I prefer this beer fresh (as opposed to a day-old growler).

3.83,4.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,"Single bottle poured into a tulip stout glass. While there was a digital stamp on the neck of the bottle, the numbers didn't obviously mean anything to me. Appearance: Translucent orange-copper beer with a very light tan head. Poured an impressive 1/2"" thick head initially, which died down to a thin head across the top with lots and lots of lacing all over the glass. Head comes back with a swirl and stays around a bit with still plenty of lacing.  Smell: Toffee-like malt with a tea-like hop smell. Very much like a classic bitter. Taste: Toffee and caramel malt up front moving quickly into a bitter finish. Every now and then there is some nutty flavors in there...peanut, walnut? Can't place it. The bitterness isn't quite as tea-like as it was in the smell, more like an English bitter finish. Very simple in the flavor profile here, with the bitterness being most of the flavor once the sweeter malt moves out of the way.  Mouthfeel: Plenty of carbonation on the tongue with something sticking to the teeth, but otherwise just a hair thicker than water. Actually, quite a lot of carbonation for a bitter. Otherwise, nothing special.  Drinkability: After drinking this, I think it would be better with food. The carbonation does a good job cleansing the palate, and I think with the simple flavor profile, it would compliment food nicely rather than get in the way. By itself though, it's just okay. Maybe a lot warmer or on cask (less carbonation) I would enjoy it more by itself. Good looking beer though.",2011-03-06,26750,Tomos Watkin Old Style Bitter

On the nose it's like a date or banana bread. On the tongue there is so much going on it's kind of hard to follow in a very pleasant way. There are apples and definitely raisin and other dark fruit notes right up front that lingers for a while, giving way to a really nicely restrained bitterness further back on the tongue that also sticks around. In the mouth it's a medium finish defined by a slightly prickly, again in a good way, slight carbonation. I can see myself sitting down for a ploughman's lunch with two of these.

3.88,4.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,"Paying homage to my Welsh ancestors with this one.  A: An English-looking ale (don't tell the Welshmen I said that) -- copper-brown, nicely hazy, thin lacing. S: Subtle grassy notes. Subtle malt. Subtlety all around. T: Malty, bitter, flinty, good. The mineral-water quality may be a bit much for some (my wife doesn't care for it) but I find it charming and refreshing. A nice floral-yeast finish to boot. M: A bit slick, a bit sweet, but no real complaints. D: Highly sessionable; great with mild Indian curries. It gets better -- comes alive, really -- as it sits in the glass.

Aroms is really bready and biscuity. Sweet and some dark fruits are apparent as well. Not sure I am liking the sweet caramel aromas of this one. I was hoping for something a little more blalanced, meaning not as sweet. Sweet on the tongue at first but followed by some roast bitterness and chocolate. I am liking the roasty bitterness but still a bit more caramel than my liking. Plenty of biscuit flavor makes this one a nearly full bodied beverage.  Due to the sweetness, I dont see this as a top tier version of the style. A little less caramel would really be spot on.

Smell was a bit hoppy and fruity, almost like apple. Had a nice malty flavor to it, with perhaps a slight twinge of pine noticed. It's a thin beer, as it's made that way. Got a bit of a dry cotton feeling in the back of the throat about three quarters of the way through the bottle. Low abv makes this an easy drinker.

3.88,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,"It pours an almost clear classic amber with gold margins. A finger of uniform off-white head descends to patchy froth. Hyphens of lacing dash along the inside of the glass.  In the aroma, tasted malt and caramel are lightly sweet and fruity. A muted floral spiciness and a couple crumbs of biscuit swirl in the distance.  Upon tasting, and aptly understated malt sweetness denotes caramel and English toffee. The hops are subtly bitter and especially crisp, with a spiciness that goes just so. The middle mellows as yeasty biscuit and the merest touch of residual grain sweetness are dried by the lingering crisp bitterness of clean living hops in the finish. It's all about subtlety and the ensuing appreciation.  Light bodied, it flows with an easy gait and closes clean and dry on the palate.  I could say subtle ten times, and I wouldn't be overstating this refreshing characteristic. This is what I want when the extreme stuff is a bit much. It's crisp and clean, low-key, and nicely drinkable. This beer says session, right out of the OED.

The nose is sweet malts, some cracked grains, nothing memorable, but certainly in line with the style. The taste is quite sweet, moderately carbonated. This is a fairly uniform, unidimensional beer with some leafy hop presence, but mostly sweet malts. Most interesting is the labelling which tells you that the taste is ""treacle"" and the beer should be paired with vegetables, beef, etc. The symbols used on the label for this purpose are a hoot, and worth seeking out on that basis alone. Of course, they also tell you that the beer should be paired with friends ... how quaint!

Red amber, it has a medium-large pale tan head slowly shrinking to a permanent foamy top and leaving some weak lace. The aroma is light winey fruit (plums, especally) with strong fresh bread and a hint of caramelized fruit. The taste is sweet-sour fruit up front with light, zesty yeastiness, a lot of dry bread, especially in the finish, hints of leaves in the finish, hint of caramelly fruit and a finish that has very light bitterness and complex mix of dry leaves, toast, citrus, and black pepper, yet leaving a lingering aftertaste of caramelly bread and fruit.

BB JAN 09, served cool in a straight imperial pint glass. A: dark reddish amber to light copper in colour, with a nice-looking off-white foamy froth sustaining well. The fine carbonation flows constantly. S: lightly metallic upfront, on top of fruits, plum jam and some earthy hops. Not so pronounced on the ""citrus"" note promised by the beer label (from UK and US hops); instead, a black tea-ish and brown sugary maltiness sneaks through the foam.  T: plenty of biscuity malts emerge from the very beginning, intertwined nicely with a floral hop flavour, while the rather light taste of citric sourness lags behind... The aftertaste packs some sour nuts and pines, with a very mild bitter palate (slightly chewy as well) in the finish. M&amp;D: fizziness comes quite light, on top of a medium body.

Not a strong nose, overall, and a rather subdued aroma. Not that that's a bad thing. Taste is smooth, not very bitter dispite being labeled as such, and dominated by the caramel flavors. The bitter flavor doesn't really hit until the end, and it's not even close to being a high IBU beer. Nice and balanced, though.

There was some dry pumpernickel bread hints, light toast, and a light bitterness as well. In the finish the dry spiciness comes through once again as well a light fruitiness of dried apples.  M: light, sweet, fruity, and softly carbonated leaving a slight sourness behind.  D: Average drinkability, not bad but nothing that would make me want to go out and buy again.

3.68,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,"Ripe kumquat with nothing but the occasional bubble disturbing the perfect clarity of the liquid. The modest cap is a lovely shade of orange-tinted ivory and has a sticky, bubbly texture that is mirrored in the copious amount of lace that finds its way to the glass. I expected the nose to be more hoppy. I also expected it to be more citrusy and less earthy. For the record, Willamette and Fuggles were used for flavor and Goldings for aroma. A metallic character doesn't ruin things, but I could certainly do without it. I'm pretty sure the earthiness is due to malt rather than hops. The darker than usual color of the beer is further evidence that a fair amount of non-pale malt is in use. Ah ha! A quick scan of the label tells me that crystal malt accompanies pale and wheat. That's too bad because I think ESBs should be hop showcases. Others may disagree, but then this is my review. Tomos Watkin OSB is balanced beer, more or less. The nutty, lightly sweet, mildly caramel-like maltiness is complemented by a herbal, grassy, cold tea hoppiness. The metal from the nose comes across as a pleasant, hard water mineralicity on the palate. It all adds up to a better than decent ale that is probably best drunk straight from the cask in Swansea rather than from a bottle in Des Moines. There isn't a thing wrong with the light-medium mouthfeel. Given the style, it's right where it needs to be. They've even done an admirable job with the lightly tingly carbonation. It may not be overly cask-like, but it's fine for a bottled product. Old Style Bitter isn't the ESB of my dreams (lose the crystal malt), but it's enjoyable beer that grew on me from first sip to last. I'd like to see more U.K. brewers exporting their wares to the U.S. As long as they're reasonably fresh when they get here, as this one seems to be.

Taste is great here, follows the style well. Has medium malts and medium hops, starts off with a good mix of fruits and citrus hops and is followed by a great malt after taste. The tongue is left with a good coat of malty flavor after the sip is done. Mouthfeel is light-medium body with good carbonation and no alcohol flavor, a bit watery here but still good for the style.

3.97,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Tawny-gold in hue with hints of amber, there was some animation noticed in the very attractive liquid. The head was white in color, at the apex the foam was about a finger in height. Head retention was fair; it quickly faded to a thin, foamy cap. This cap lasted the entire consumption. The subsequent lacing was spotty and minimal. This is a pleasant looking beverage. The nose is pleasant, kind of clean yet English in nature. Malt is dominant, dry, toasty, and nutty with some rich sweetness from a caramel twist. The hops offer hints of pine needles, spicy flowers, and earthy qualities. Simple. Modest potency. There isnt anything noteworthy about the bouquet; it says all the right things so its fine by me. Well-rounded. Inviting. The palate is lovely. Now a beer of these sorts cant be forceful and loud while remaining true. Since this beer tastes appropriate it is done right and that is all I can ask for. The malt is plenty flavorful; this seems to be the flaw of many American beers, especially of this sort. Not so for Daniel Shay. Rich, kind of sweet maltiness; brown sugar and nutty flavors that encompass some toasty qualities as well. Caramel. Juicy. The malt profile is very English. The hops offer just enough bitterness; if a 10 on the hoppy scale is a DIPA this beer is a 3.3 and that is about perfect. Spicy. Earthy with a grassy and pine tree bark twang. I like it greatly. The aftertaste is lazy; it is a sum of all the pervious parts. Tasty palate. Medium/medium-light in body with modest yet natural carbonation. There is a slight creaminess on the tongue, which works well. The mouthfeel is quite pleasant. I found this beer to be very tasty and just as drinkable. I am sure this beer would be great with a smoked turkey and Gouda sandwich, followed by three or four more pints! Maybe Ill get the chance to do that someday. This is a very nice Bitter.

I don't really enjoy this beer. M: The carbonated spiciness is nice; nothing else is. D: As beers go, this is not one of the best.

The large white foam that was there at first died down pretty quickly to leave nothing behind.  Smell: At first, a tad smoky with mild sulfur notes, but as it warmed up, it was more of a roasted malt with some hints of sulfate. Okay.  Taste: Predominantly bitter through and through, but once the beer was well warmed up, a sweeter malt with some smokey hints shows up in the middle between the bitter start and finish. I should point out that the bitterness is not bad - it's not an American hop slap - it's more of a nice bitterness which goes really well with a meal. I didn't get it at first, but it grew on me as I finished the glass.  Mouthfeel: No carbonation at all, but that's okay. Just thick enough to be noted as not water, but goes down smoothly. Does leave a little bit on the teeth.  Drinkability: Went very well with a meal (grilled porkchop) and if I had more time that evening, I may have had another and let it grow on me.

A: pours a bright amber colour with mild reddish hues, coming with a fluffy off-white head with good retention, and rather mild carbonation. S: astringent citric and grassy scent of hops is underlined by a clean whiff of pale malts, at times giving out a light dusty note almost identical to that of bottled lager beers; a swirl gives rise to mildly sulphuric notes and a wee touch of sweet applely esters. T: a fairly clean swallow of mildly fruity-flavoured malty theme with a particularly lingering aftertaste of (yum-like) starchy sweetness, underlined by an equally lingering touch of hop bitterness and a dry palate in the end. The bitter palate echoes the malt sweetness on a very good balance, all in all. M&amp;O: despite the “late application of hops”, this lightly carbonated and medium-bodied beer doesn’t taste that hoppy or aromatic as far as my palate is concerned, but the double dropping fermentation method does render a cleaner texture in a beer that achieves a balanced target b/w pure pale malts and bittering hops. Not as dry as Braskspear’s Bitter (Wychwood), which utilises the same double dropping fermentation system as this beer does (I believe, as Wychwood is now part of the Marston's family), but the fruity and lightly sulphuric undertones are there to be enjoyed in addition.

Aroma of lightly roasted malt with notes of toffee, stewed leaves and butter. There is also a faint initial hint of fruit such as peach or orange, but this disappears as it warms. Tastes of roasted malt with a mild, dry bitterness. Notes of toffee/caramel, stewed hops and hints of burnt grain. There is also a buttery flavour in the background (diacetyl). No aromatic hops, despite the label describing a 'late application of hops'. Mouthfeel is smooth and tingly, but perhaps a little thin. Aftertaste of bitter roasted malt. Average. The malt and bitterness are quite nicely balanced but it's still rather dull. Not sure what impact the double dropping has - I can think of an alternative 'double dropped' ale with a better flavour.

Slight acerbic character on the front palate, with a slight battery acid phenolic edge and a hint of black tea. Bitterness subsides slightly on the middle and then returns, potent as ever, for a double dip on the finish.  It's herbal and quite phenolic, real alkaline edge to it, which demands attention but doesn't really detract from drinkability. Well, the aftertaste IS mildly unpleasant, but very mildly.  Mouthfeel is slightly full but not sticky, a little bit foamy from the carbonation, pretty fine really. An interesting brew. Quite chuggable.

3.22,3.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.0,"Hargreaves Hill is one of those breweries who I’ve glanced at and thought “their marketing’s too posh for my tastes, and I’ve got far too many beers to review as it is, so: pass”. However at the very beginning of 2017 I was staying in Yarra Glen (Victoria) and I stopped by for a pint. It was called HOA (which stood for “Hop Oat Ale”) and it was so delicious and creamy textured that I drank a pint in about 5 mins. Then I had to drive 500 meters down the road, so I wasn’t allowed to try any more beers, poo. Fast forward to today and I’ve decided to give them a chance starting with their ESB - which I deemed the hardest style in their core range. Poured from a 330ml bottle into a nonic pint. A: Cloudy caramel/amber body with a boisterous 3 centimetre beige head that ever so slowly dissolves leaving lace on the side of the glass. A bit on the cloudy side for an ESB, and that’s one heady, err, head… but otherwise OK. 6/10. S: Dulcet caramel/toffee malts and a hint of earthy/nutty tones rounds out an ESB that certainly fits the ESB bill fine, however I wonder when the “new world” hops on the bottle label will show up… Christmas? Probably. 7/10. T: Earthy and dirty upfront (too earthy/dirty IMO), mid-palate comes in with some OK nutty/caramel/toffee characters… then it sort of drops off there with a light herbal bitterness in the finish. Certainly no hops of note - perhaps a bit of hop fade here? But let’s forget about the hops and rate it as a straight up-and-out ESB: It doesn’t compare favourably to most UK ESB’s, but then it does beat out a few Aussie ones… TBH us Aussies seem to be shit at brewing ESB’s… which is a shame because I do love a good ESB, my ESP goes wild for ESB. 6/10. M: At least the body has a decent heft to it - medium bodied with a thin but active carbonation. 8/10. D: First tinge of disappointment from Hargreaves Hill after HOA with this lacklustre ESB, and I can tell you exactly where they went wrong with this brew: Relying on the hops to carry a style that is malt-driven - there’s a reason all the tastiest ESB’s work: The malt bill. In an ESB hops are secondary to a decent malt bill and this ESB doesn’t have that. It’s got a slight bit of playful caramel/toffee/nuttiness, but then it’s also got a bit too much earthy/dirtiness… then that light herbal blip in the finish - give me a decent fruity/floral hopping any day in an ESB - that’s where it’s at! 6/10.

3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Seafarers has a golden colour and glistening amber hue. It can't really be considered either dark or light. Despite its deep tone the clarity is perfect and its head, which sits atop the beer like a clump of mashed potatoes, is smooth and steady - looks like smooth sailing tonight!  Fireworks are as unlikely to find in a traditional English Bitter as they are at a funeral; these ales are intended for everyday consumption which, by definition, means that there's nothing characteristically all that special about them. The Brits customarily brew a simple, straight-forward ale; the most distinguishing factor is often the mildness. Seafarer follows in this tradition and doesn't have a tremendous flavour profile by any means. Still, what's there is nothing if not pleasant: biscuity and toffee-laced malts, dried fruit esters, a brisk rash of herbal hoppiness. It has an agreeableness that matches that of its alcohol content (3.6%).  The recipe features a prominent fruitiness that is partially attributed to its malts and partly the ale yeast esters. It is most appreciable in the aroma which has distinct notes of plum, apple, raisin, and apricot (both dried and fresh). These fruity flavours compliment the faintly floral, herbal qualities of the hops. There's nothing especially overt, but all the flavours come together nicely.  For me, my enjoyment of certain styles can be contingent on certain factors (i..e, whether it's fresh, whether I'm in the particular mood for it, what time of year it is, etc) and, in my experience, English Bitters seem best in social settings where copious consumption is a likely possibility. What I mean to say is that one pint of Seafarer isn't as satisfying as two (or more).  On-tap at Beer Bistro in Toronto.",2014-03-12,24387,Seafarers

Everytime I went back to this fantastic Gale's pub, they happened to have a seasonal beer alongside their regular range of brews: Butser, GB, HSB, Festival Mild... And this special one is said to be brewed partly for charity purpose, donating 5 pence out of each pint to... (well, I forgot which maritime association).  Appearance: it pours a bright, dark amber or orange copper hue, on top of it is a very thin, off-white beerhead, with very low carbonation. Smell: at first it's light pale-malty, while gradually revealing is a refreshing, hay-like hoppy note and slightly citrusy zesty bitter aroma. Taste: on the palate, it's simply hoppy--slightly tart fruity, on top of a freshly-cut hay's grassy flavour; the finish is crisply dry, with a tangy kickback of zesty hops, while in the aftertaste I sense a residual acidic feel on the palate which I don't quite like. Mouthfeel &amp; Drinkability: overall the mouthfeel is lively, though it tends to turn flat bit by bit, perhaps due to its lack of freshness or for any other reason I can't specify. The body is light, as is the flavour. On the balance it reminds me of Gale's GB, but the latter, to my best recollection, is more pleasantly hoppy, dry, and has a more pronounced flavour than this special brew.

S: There are light to moderately strong aromas of fruity yeast and grapes in the nose along with hints of floral hops. T: The taste has flavors of fruity yeast along with notes of malty sweetness and a slight amount of bitterness. M: It feels light- to medium-bodied and slightly chewy on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. O: This beer is easy to drink and quite sessionable.

The finish is gentle and grassy with caramel, biscuit, and grassy, peppery hop flavors. M: Light bodied and very dry with spritzy, stinging carbonation. This is a very quaffable ale that would be great on a hot, sunny day. O: I find this to be an interesting bitter/pale ale. I really like the fact that it is bottle conditioned.

Notes: The bottle says: ""The first Bottle Conditioned Ale brewed deliberately to taste great chilled"". When I poured the beer was 46f. I like this beer, even if I don't love it. It fits the bill as a solid, only brewed in England Pale Ale with enough character and taste for repeat drinkings.

I can only imagine it would be lovely from a hand-pump or cask. But it looks decent enough now. Nose is slightly hopped, with a green leafy aroma that mingles with sweet acetaldehyde characters of turpentine and apple brandy. To be honest, it's a bit offputting, with a chemical buzz that feels unnecessary and sharp. The sweetness is also a little offputting, giving some estery characters that seem out of place. Taste is better, but only because it's extremely bland. Light damp grain characters with a yeasty, floury finish that give a dryness, but no crispness or refreshment. Slight earthy hops on the back, but they're also dry and flat, and giving very little in the way of character. Feel is light and smooth. Very disappointing. It's extremely flat and rather flavourless. I can't find a freshness date on the bottle, but it feels like perhaps it's a bit old.

Smell really highlights the hops. Very floral and tasty. I am also getting quite a lot of character from the yeast. Malts are well balanced and hold up the beer well.

Citrus fruits sour the taste a little too much for me, but it is refreshing, hoppyness saves the day, not your normal British Bitter, but tastey non-the-less.

The back label specifies that ""Blue is the first bottle conditioned ale brewed deliberately to taste great chilled"", plus a huge sign of snow flake and a sentence in block capitals as the second reminder: ""FOR DRINKING COLD""... perhaps yet another attempt to win over lager drinkers? Trying too hard, I think, and I don't like the idea of cold ales anyway. BB 15/07/07, served just sli...ghtly cooler than cool in a straight imperial-pint glass. A: pours a reddish orangey hue, slightly murky due to yeast sediments; the off-white comes quite puffy but sustains surprisingly well, against a moderately-carbonated body, full of tiny bubbles--looking rather healthy. S: tart, damp, pear-ish and slightly pineapple-ish yeasty note upfront, common to quite a few British microbreweries' bottle-conditioned beers... also at presence is the sour-sweet orangey edge of English hops and a bed of mildly sweet pale malt. A good swirl helps reveal deeper, flowery and piney aromas of hops, but not lingering and hiding underneath the overall sour note. Not too bad overall, but the sour yeastiness is slightly overpowering. T: an assertively effervescent texture full of sharp, tiny fizz attacks my tastebuds... almost like an overly fizzy lager! struggling over the fizziness, my palate picks up some sour citric flavour on top of neutral pale malts, which quickly gives way to grapefruit-peel's zesty as well as yeasty bitterness, and a rather rusty/tannic, almost piney touch of hops manifesting at the rear of the palate... the good lingering tangy bitterness and increasingly dry palate lend some pleasant length--perhaps the most enjoyable part of the beer. M&amp;D: the mouthfeel is way too fizzy for an ale, more in line with wild Biere de Garde for that matter... It takes a good while for the texture to soften before one's palate could better appreciate the flavour. Apart from that, this is a distinctively bitter Premium (pale) Bitter with a a rather crisp and dry palate due to rich content of hops. Quaffable alright, but hardly an impressive bitter in my book. And I truly wonder why it should be consumed COLD as recommended on the bottle? In that case even the zesty hops could be killed off altogether, leaving nothing to taste but bitterness and fizz!!",2006-09-21,32862,Blue

The body is light amber and almost clear, a slight haze hangs in the glass, on top a white head struggled to keep afloat, it slowly faded away leaving a wispy covering surrounded by a thicker collar. Many smells came into my nose (the pub was full), but I think the beer gave off aromas of caramel biscuits, lightly baked and dropped into a box of pink-grapefruit before being used in the brew! The taste was a good mix of flavours, mini citrus notes and those caramel biscuits from the smell marry together nicely: this is so easy to drink.

3.24,2.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.25,"500 mL bottle from the LCBO; dated Feb 1 2016 and served well-chilled. This gluten free beer is medium yellow-gold in colour, with a crystal clear complexion. An aggressive pour failed to produce any lasting head - a half-finger of loose, bone white froth was produced, but fizzled off within 20 seconds. No lacing; no cap. Weird nose - I've reviewed more than a thousand beers in my day, but the aroma on this one is leaving me at a loss for accurate descriptive terms. Grain husk and honey biscuit, with boiled vegetables, compost and weakly floral hop notes. Tastes better than it smells - almost like a real English bitter, though it's not exactly difficult to tell that this isn't technically ""beer"" (at least, in the traditional sense). More grain husk, with notes of honey sweetness, boiled vegetables and muddled citrus pith. Finishes with a leafy, grassy, floral note that persists into the aftertaste. The hops save this one, giving it actual depth beyond the unusual vegetal sorghum-derived flavours. Light-ish in body, with moderately low carbonation levels and a very smooth texture in the mouth. Sessionable in theory; in practice, I'd rather drink their organic pale ale.  Final Grade: 3.24, a C+. Speaking as a BA who lacks any sort of valid excuse to be drinking gluten-free beer in the first place - I'd say that, compared to many of its competitors, St. Peter's G-Free is a genuinely respectable effort - which makes it a virtual must-try for celiacs (or anyone else on the GF bandwagon). While this beer does taste a little weird to my palate, I can't honestly say that it isn't one of the best GF brews I've tried to date. This is mostly due to the presence of the Amarillo hops, whose floral, citrusy tendencies somewhat complement the grainy, honey-like sweetness of the sorghum. Is it the sort of thing I'm likely to buy again? Well, no - certainly not at $4 a pint. But if you're a celiac looking for something that at least begins to approximate a craft beer, this is as good a place to start as any.",2016-08-18,46812,St. Peter's G-Free (Gluten Free Beer)

3.46,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,"St. Peter's G-Free doesn't look like any less of a beer for not using barley or wheat. In fact, it has the same characteristic golden colour and shiny, clear complexion as any other English bitter. Where it comes up short, however, is in its inability to produce (or at least retain) any head.  Just because someone has an allergy to wheat doesn't mean they can't enjoy hops! Why do so many brewery overlook this? Heck, half the beer drinkers I know prefer a flavour dominated by hops anyhow. I'm glad St. Peter's recognizes this and uses citrusy, floral Amarillo hops.  Though they smell slightly different in combination with the exceptionally chalky mineral-dense water, the hops' key signatures of zested citrus and orange blossoms are fully appreciated. These fruity, leafy flavours show up even bolder on the palate where the impress a grassy bitterness that nearly makes us forget altogether about grain.  The hops don't have much legs behind them (as they rarely do in simple English bitters) but the flavour of oranges, though gentle, doesn't flee away that fast. And while sorghum doesn't quite emulate the wholesome, bready toastiness of barley, it does have a clean and lightly honeyed cereal taste that makes it a very agreeable alternative.  Gluten-free beer generally serves as a reminder that if I suffered from celiac disease I'd probably lose all interest in living. Most are simply that unfortunate. But St. Peter's G-Free is actually a proper, serviceable gluten-free ale that I find not only tolerable, but enjoyable. Turns out there's hope yet in the world for our poor gluten-sensitive friends (and fad dieters).",2013-06-12,46812,St. Peter's G-Free (Gluten Free Beer)

Woody nut shells with a little lemon and orange peel were joined by a floral earthy note like Darjeeling tea, peach, unripe pineapple, mint, and a pleasant crystal malt caramel chew along with some toasty notes.

There is also some some buttery notes with a touch of grapefruit. It ends with a malty sweet aftertaste with a bit of a lingering hop bitterness. Overall - This bottle was a little out of date, so probably not hr best example. I'd like to try it fresh to give it a fair a shot.

3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,Bottle: Poured a cloudy dirty beige color ale with a small foamy head with limited retention and almost no lacing. Aroma of dry hops with light bitterness notes. Taste is a mix between dry malt backbones with some dry bitter hops notes. Body is quite full with limited carbonation.

3.72,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.5,"660ml bottle, part of a swath of new English microbrewery offerings available 'round here. This beer pours a hazy pale amber hue, with less than a finger of crackling, soda-pop-esque white head, which bleeds away quickly, rendering little in the way of lace anywhere near this affair. It smells of bitter earthy, noble hops, and caramel malt. The taste is biscuity, crackery malt, and mild, but still very agreeable earthy, citrus hops. The carbonation is very sedate, the body light, smooth, and a bit airy - kind of a cask experience in a bottle. It finishes barely off-dry, with a little malt malt and even fewer remaindered hops. Not seeing this kind of beer in these parts very often, it's hard to immediately appreciate its subtly - malt, hops, and alcohol, all in perfect proportion, but well fettered, so that I may drink more. Good thing, as that Rogan Josh I've been waiting on deserves a nice 'bitters' accompaniment...",2011-07-29,58084,Revival

The taste is complex as well with piney, tangy, slightly resiny hops the star. I'm also getting some apricot, tea, caramel, biscuity malt and grapefruit. This thing is smooth as hell with a great tangy, bitter finish. The drinkability is crazy. I paid a lot for this, but it was worth every penny.

What beautiful looking beer! Great reddy, deep rustic brown body, clear and bright. Minute bubbles rising up to the wonderfully formed light tanned foaming head which sits like a crown on top. Good heavy lacing on the glass as I ploughed my way through the brew. Toffee notes in the nose and semi-sweet molasses from the malts. The malts rule the taste challenge, the hops only arriving later as the mouth drys. I thought the mouth dried very quickly, leaving a hop bitterness in the throat. The brewery claim it has ""a smooth malty bitter sweet finish"" on the rear label, can't agree with that. OK the dryness could be a mix of maltiness and hops combined, but smooth it wasn't.

Thankfully, we don't just look at beer. Ripe apples and a hint of blackberry in the nose ... faint roasted grain and burnt sugar as well. Wonderfully smooth and without missing a step, the quick crispness primes the palate for what the beer has to offer. A bit of body to go around; roasty but mellow. Pressed tea leaves, chicory and dry cocoa nibs come to mind. Nutty yeast with an herbal woody hoppiness join in on the dry finish.

Malty rich grains of caramel, almost toffee, and shortbread fill the nose. A pungenty earty, spicy aroma is obviously hop deriven and give balance the the otherwise sweeter nose. Fruity esters put the English Ale signature on the aroma. Sweeter early with the caramel/toffee malts, the beer fades slowly into a boldy bitter and earthy/spicy hoppiness after mid-palate and only intensifies in the finish and aftertaste. All the while with the soft fruity flavors of apples, plumbs, and other non-descript fruitiness. Moderate in weight, the beer has a malty-creamy texture early, but the beer sharpens up considerably going into the finish with a minty, grassy hop taste/bitter, leading with an almost grainy flavor and feel.

Low carbonation with a medium body: A little thick in the mouth with some refreshing fruitiness on the tongue.  It is always surprising how complex these english ales can be for so little alcohol.

Best by 01/01/2011 This pours darker than the Tawny, a deep reddish brown with over a finger's worth of billowy foam but minimal lacing. Still..it has a great look in my glass.  Taking some whiffs, it has a nice mix of roasty and biscuit malt, and nutty notes with some hoppy bitterness on the back end. A different nose than the Tawny but again, quite nice. My first sip brings the nicely not overdone biscuit flavour, a nice subtle nuttiness, a flavourful presence of hop bitterness that's hard to classify...not really citrus pine or grass, just plain old bitterness and it works for me. Smack dab in the middle of everything that is going on is a very tasty addition of toffee! Wow, what a fine dimension it brings to the taste of this Bitter. I'd say if it wasn't there, the balance of Barn Owl wouldn't be where it is and that would be a shame. I'm loving this English Bitter! Medium bodied with low carbonation, this is such a smooooth beer and going back to appearance, the foam and lacing continue to shine. Drinkability? It is 4.5%abv, which technically isn't within sessionable beer territory, but I can't sense any increase in the alcohol vs the 3.8% Tawny which I had earlier. To me, this far outshines its lighter weight brother in every way but please don't shy away from trying any Cotleigh brew you can find. The 2 I've had so far are emminently drinkable.

The taste was initially dominated with malts, but this is then followed by a hoppy after-note and a sampling of biscuit and nuts. The overall aftertaste was rather dry, slightly odd for this type of beer. The mouthfeel was medium-heavy, about right for this type of beer.

I might have liked a tad more sweetness to balance the bitterness, but this is still an excellent beer. As the beer warms up, the malts come even more in front, and the bitterness is somewhat less dominant.",2006-12-29,18652,Barn Owl Premium Bitter

3.9,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,"Single bottle (no date) poured into a Tulip stout glass. Appearance: Hazy orange to tarnished copper on the table, some red in there when held up to the light. Poured a off-white 1/4"" head, but this died down rather quickly to a ring around the glass and a thin skin of foam in the middle. Delicate strands of lacing noted. I noticed after pouring that there was sediment in the bottle, so I wonder what I would have gotten on a gentle pour. Smell: Some toffee and mild fruit/apple notes. A classic English-style ale smell. Taste: Toffee again, with some fruity flavors (apple and cider-like, but not a tart apple) moving into a burnt toffee and very mild bitter finish. The bitter finish is again what one would expect from a English bitter, but it is muted due to the heavier malt profile here. That malt profile is still balanced - it's never cloying in my opinion.  Mouthfeel: A little fizzy on the tongue which gets in the way of everything else. And perhaps I could say it is more carbonated than what I would expect in a typical English ale. Otherwise the mouthfeel is nothing special.  Drinkability: A very solid ale - went very well with a meal (mustard pork chops and potatoes) and I could see this going well with a lot of foods. Easy to drink and while I keep comparing it to English-style ales, I have to remember it is Welsh and some of the differences may lie there, such as the carbonation.

Upon tasting, the malt is flat and blunt with caramel, toffee, and biscuit, but no sense of sugar. A thin spread of yeast and dough don't quite inspire, but they do represent. There's no real residual grain presence, and it's only in the finish that the hops assert enough to give off a very general but crisp, lingering bitterness. There's not much going on, but there's a little something there.  Light bodied, it really flies across the palate but a little patience reveals a crisp, clean note.  It's a on trick pony that isn't really all that tricky. Still, as the session beer it purports itself to be, it does pretty well. In fact, its simplicity makes it drinkable and in no way taxing.

T: refreshing and dryish texture of peat-smoked maltiness and raw-nuttiness dominate the palate upfront; turning incredibly smooth afterwards, backed by the lingering flow of mild nuttiness sustaining firmly at the back along with a little herbal touch, but showing little sign of that sweetish aroma on the nose, thus quite welcomed.

Aroma is light and quite fruity, hints of citrus come through next to the tropical scents which dominate next to dry, biscuit-like maltiness.

On the first sniff I thought I was going to be disappointed but after a couple of minutes, a bit of warming and swirling , notes of floral grassy hops, pale malt and citrusy fruits came trough nicely. Tastes of tropical fruits, good malt presence to balance everything and make this bitter very drinkable.

No yeasty chunks. Very sweet and citrusy aroma, with a touch of toast and floral hops. Oooh, did it taste good. One of those beers that just seems to hit the spot. Sweet and tangy citrus, bit of a malt backbone, and a metallic flavour that actually blended in and seemed right. Mouthfeel was light and somewhat chewy.

3.89,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,"500ml bottle, BB February 2008.  The write-up suggest I could also enjoy the beer cloudy by introducing the sediment; although it wouldn't seem any is needed, the appearance is considerably dulled as is. A sickly looking honey colour with very poor retention. The thin spit of head that exist is holed and looks moth eaten (although it would leave sticky lacing). The presentation - from colour to complexion - appears unhealthy.  I have far fewer - if any - complaints about the aroma. A delightfully bold bouquet of esters and fruit tones. Minor hints of exotic flavours like pineapple and mango, grapefruit as well, all which carry a very ""green"", plant/vegetable like overtone. There's a really distant spice to the hops too... The nice thing this beer does is via it's hops, which harmonize sweetness with bitterness. The two features together, balanced, make for a very nice drinking beer. A worthy session. Slightly metallic, high mineral character that is always present in the British bitters. Despite a light flavour profile, the body has some weight to it. The taste of honey lingers. A grainy taste of wheat dries out some of the flavour, although pineapple and grapefruit still come through, dried apricots more and more. The spice from the hops becomes apparent as it warms.  Considerably enjoyable. The hoping is fantastic and creates a seamless balance between sweet and bitter. I'd take this over many other UK bitters...",2007-11-17,12480,Live Organic

A very light biscuity malt profile is definitely the second chair in this duet. The yeast flavor is dry and lacking in fruit/diacetyl esters for a british ale. Light tangy hops linger in the finish.

A: bright reddish amber hue with great clarity (for a bottle-conditioned beer); a restrained layer of off-white froth settles to a fluffy carpet on top of very gentle streams of slowly-ascending bubbles... Looking rather blissful. S: ever since the bottle is opened, the strong aroma of sticky burned sugar, like caramelised-crust of Creme Brulee, has expanded everywhere... as well as the infamous buttery note of English beers~~! against a very solid backbone of orangey and floral hoppyness, stinky edge of oxidised honey, faint tinge of prunes and berries, as well as a savoury-sweet hint of Brakspear yeastiness also found at presence in their other products. Pleasant but dominated by that strong malty theme. T: a smooth flow of lovely biscuity and milder caramely maltiness comes in conjunction with plenty of chewy, flaky hops (tasting familiar but I just can't come up with the varieties)... gradually turning slightly roasty-dryish and somewhat bitter-sweet, zesty and soothingly nutty down the wings of the tongue, finished with very pleasant, moderate hop-bitterness with an indescribable sour edge to keep a balance and hook the palate. M&amp;D: the carbonation is ideal for a bottle-conditioned beer~~ ever so smooth to make the beer taste as close to cask-conditioned ale as possible--good job!

A: pours a pale golden that comes with restrained carbonation and a slowly-dissipating white fluffy head. S: quite sweet is the nose, like liquidy sugar cane on top of the traditional aroma of English Goldings that is sweet tangerine-ish in a sense, plus a touch of butter. The highly likely pasteurisation process seems to endow a burned sugary hint as well to the overall aroma. Quite straight-forward and not outstanding. T: the flavour is just as straight forward as the nose, but with a bit more elements to entertain the tastebuds - the lightly orangey-citric foretaste comes with a faintly grassy &amp; buttery tinge, and fiantly powdery pale malts, not as sweet as the nose suggests; then, the hop tannins and lightly woody bitterness follow up and expand down the wings of the tongue. The finish is restrained on the level of bitterness, but slightly chewy still. M&amp;D: pretty light and refreshing, not quite fizzy as most bottled ales are, but the overall flavour profile comes semi-mundane and the balance fails to materialise, while the addition of buttery note and taste is not particularly helpful, either.

Aftertaste of dry yeast and bitter stewed hops. Fairly average - certainly doesn't come across as a strong ale. The balance is OK but I'm not enjoying the stewed hop bitterness. A relatively dull beer; there just isn't anything about this that would make me want another. Don't go out of your way to find it....",2012-03-17,24919,Bishop's Tipple

Great head production at about three fingers thick of off white color, and the lacing is great. Aroma is of tea, leather, and lemony/metallic hops. Taste wise this is fruity with lemon upfront, which dissolves into a tea and buttery flavor. This is wetting to the palate with prickly carbonation.

Smell: Delicate, floral hop aroma. Some spiciness as well. Malt is understated in the nose. Light caramel notes emerge as it warms. Delicate is the right word. Taste: Solidly bitter. The combination of English ale fruitiness and continental hops like Saaz is a bit surprising at first, but never constitutes an identity crisis. Especially out of the bottle, the classification on BA as a bitter seems a bit of a puzzle. Mouthfeel: Light-medium body, lively carbonation. Long finish, but the aftertaste is a bit wanting, simultaneously watery and astringent. Drinkability: I must have been living in the UK too long, looking at 5.5% abv and thinking that's a lot.

4.3,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,"This is a very good beer, like all of Wadworth's beers I have tasted, be they cask or bottled. Most of the 500ml bottle got into my Hoegaarden Grand Cru glass on the first pour, the rest arrived very soon afterwards! Light amber, copper colour with a swiftly disappearing white head (I blame the gurkins). This review is being conducted with a little snack of gurkins, olive bread and a french soft cheese (Le Pie d'Angloys), I know it should be tasted on its own, but the Bishop would approve, even if the purists don't. The aroma is very sweet, caramel and hops fighting it out, with a sacarin sweetness winning, I like it. Like a lot of stronger UK beers, they get sweeter as they move up the alcohol ladder, this is no different, again, I have no problem with this, but sometimes wonder why we can't produce a strong, bitter tasting beer. This beer hangs around in the mouth (even with gurkins about), it is not as sweet later on, a spicy hoppy flavour arrives at the end. I think this is a very pleasant beer and will be having some more whenever I see it, I bet the draught (cask) version is out of this world.",2006-12-14,24919,Bishop's Tipple

I can taste coriander, which is not in there for sure, OK let's say fruity and herbal spicy. Could this be the hops? The beer has a rather sweet taste that remind me of exotic fruit like pineapple and mango.

S: at the front there's strong indication of spicy hops, almost like Fuggles or Styrian Goldings, with a woody and buttery orange-cake like touch... balanced and well-structured nose, albeit not overly complex. T: mild, juicy malts and a deeply fruity aroma on the palate...gradually taken over by a citric (grape-fruit) zesty, and gradually closing-in, intensively dry and bitter finish. The aftertaste is so dry that is almost like that of eating acidic yellow-grapefruit! Good hoppy flavour sustains in the long, lingering finish.

3.84,4.0,3.75,4.0,3.5,3.75,"Appearance- Pours up about a finger's worth of head which has a tiny bit of retention. The head is a pure cotton white while the body is a dark amber which appears as a medium amber. Good amount of sheeting extends from the surface of the beer. Nose- Faint citrus- mostly orange and lemon. Very bright and sunny after it opens up. Nice clean notes of biscuit and cracker. Grain as well. Swirling shows a slight mustiness that adds more complexity. Taste- Very nice, very complex, and very English. Lots of citrus (strong orange and lemon) which moves into the earth and grass of traditional English hops. Slight grain and biscuit. Some spice and even a little bit of grit on the finish. The slight tingle and a minor effervescence seem to come from the hop spice. Slight pine and wood. Much more subtlety than a lot of American ales. Slight note of black tea to the finish. I can readily see the appeal of such a flavorful and sessionable beer. Very well rounded with a light bitter finish. Mouthfeel- A little more than light bodied with a small bit of grit (some sediment) which I like. Healthy carbonation is perhaps a little too much. It almost seems as if Alan is compensating for something. Drinkability- Very easygoing. Pretty much crisp and refreshing. 2.50 is a great price for a 12 oz pour of such a flavorful, light beer. Overall- Pretty good beer and great representation of the style. I will have to seek out more of these 3-4% English beers. Definitely worth a try.",2013-10-21,66540,Little Dog (Fred)

Bready, with a bit of cereal grain and biscuit to it. Some mild bitterness in the finish. M - Light bodied, with soft lower growler carbonation. A tad watery, but it's a small beer so I expected as much. Fairly refreshing. D - A solid session beer that helped to break up Hair of the Dog's high-ABV lineup.

Aroma of light grainy malt with aromatic hop notes; hints of mango, tropical fruits and citrus. Also some earthy yeast and a touch of sweet honey. Tastes of light malt with an aromatic hop character and a dry finish. Notes of mango, grapefruit, tropical fruit, citrus, melon - a great blend of fruit flavours. Some sweetness, again resembling honey, with earthy yeast and subtle stewed hops in the background. A crisp, restrained bitterness upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is light, dry and tingly, with good body. Somewhat astringent. Aftertaste of floral hop notes and yeast. Yum - light and flavoursome, the perfect hot weather beer. Great balance. The aromatic hops taste lovely; distinctive and fruity, while the malt and yeast notes complement the hops perfectly. The nose could have a bit more going for it.

Slight citrus flavour as well, backed by a bit of biscuity malt in the middle. Quite a balanced finish. Solid mouthfeel, pretty well balanced to the style, which is more of a Golden Ale than a Bitter.  Overall, i can see why it won the Champion Beer of Britain, twice in consecutive years.

Later an English apple orchard and country garden fragrance added to the enjoyment within the smells. Hoppy flavour, not overpowering, but hops dominate the taste, be the beer cold or warming. A good quality Bitter with all the attributes to make it an agreeable drink. The 5% ABV sits happily within the brew and although not hidden, is masked well by the lingering bitterness in the aftertaste.

Thin sticky rings of lacing are left in the wake as this bitter disappears. Crisp bready malt on the nose, light floral and spicy hops. Dandelion greens rise up as it warms. Pleasant doughy malt upfront, a bit toasted. Mild herbal hops throughout and on the finish. A touch astringent in the aftertaste, but that's what we showed up for with this style. Mouthfeel is full yet smooth, putting this in good ranks for an excellent session ale. A very enjoyable bitter, it is mild which is par for the style, yet the quality and substance is apparent.

Aroma is of English hops and caramel. Herbal and floral at once, not overpowering, but more pronounced than the malt aroma. Taste is fruitier than the aroma, but still leans towards the hops more than the malt. Grapefruit like citrus flavour, a bit of crackers, some lighter fruits, like apple and pear. Refreshing. Mouthfeel is on the light side. Carbonation isn't overdone. Overall nothing special but suitable. Not hard to drink, but after a pint I don't want for more of it.

A little bit of cloudiness, I must have let some sediment in from an aggressive pour.  I have a bit of a cold, this beer deserves better, but I'll give it a shot. Hops in the aroma give a fresh woodiness with some slight pine that I haven't seen much in the English beers I've tried before. Prior reviewer's note on herb or mint is apt, there is a slight medicinal quality to the aroma.  This is a hop-forward English bitter. Bitterness comes in relatively strong with some of the mint mentioned above. Heavy with pine flavour and some citrus zest bitterness. Deep, very satisfying malts, whiskey soaked bread pudding, toast and pulpy orange. Description isn't doing it justice, incredibly complex for a standard bitter.  This would be killer on cask. As is, it's still decent body-wise. I like my bitters leaning towards flat, this has some fairly lively carbonation. Very smooth drinker and relatively high alcohol is well hidden. This is an absolutely wonderful example of one of my favourite styles. I will definately be heading back to the LCBO to see if any more of these are hanging around.

The evidence of bottle fermentation quite apparent from the second, smaller pour that was full of chunky yeast, clumps and suspended particles.

Citrus rind and lemon candy abound as the glass warms, as well as the typical earthy Goldings hop profile. Sweet caramel drenched bread malts strike a perfect balance. The finish is bitter and herbal from the generous hopping. The mouthfeel is luxuriously smooth with micro carbonation.  This is benchmark bitter.

4.19,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.5,3.5,"Appearance - This beers pours with a head of about an inch, but it dissapates quickly, leaving a very nice lacing down the side of the glass. The beer itself is an orangish brown colour, much the colour of toffee or caramel, and it is quite hazy as a result of bottle conditioning I'd assume. Smell - The smell of fruit, ie banana's and dates is the first thing that I detect on the aroma of this beer. Those smells develop quickly into an almost rummy/raisiny type smell with just a hint of a bubblegumesque aroma. Over all the aroma is fairly sweet smelling and definately challenging and pleasent. Very fine indeed. Taste - The beer devlops a mild nutty maltiness on the body that definately has a hint of sweetness, but this is very much shoved aside on the finish by the immense bitter hop finish. The hops have a rather citric resin flavour and are very lingering and intense. Very much in the style of an English bitter although not the best I've ever had, it has a pleasing unique flavour. Mouthfeel - This beer has a very wonderful mouthfeel with a very soft and creamy texture that is very pleasing. The carbonation is soft and gentle which is great before the bitterness. Drinkability - This beer is quite a fine beer although I couldn't see myself drinking more than a pint of it.

3.38,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,"500 mL bottle from a Marston's sampler picked up at the LCBO; best before July 31 2015. Served slightly chilled. Pours a bright, clear orange-amber colour, topped at first with one finger of foamy, white-coloured froth that recedes rapidly over the next minute or two. A bubbly film and collar remain behind afterwards, with little in the way of lace. The aroma is mild and fairly non-descript - pale malts, toffee sweetness, canned stone fruit and some floral, leafy hops are all I can manage to pick out of this one.  The taste follows the nose fairly closely. The malts provide a touch of toffee and grain sweetness, with some ripe orchard fruit notes surfacing mid-sip. Some subdued leafy, floral hop bitterness comes through toward the finish, with a neutral, minerally aftertaste. Light-bodied, with moderate carbonation levels that provide this ale with a relatively crisp, smooth mouthfeel. This is not a poorly-brewed beer, but it's one of the least-interesting brews I've had in weeks. Given the low abv of this beer (and the nature of this style in general), that's not exactly serious criticism. It's just the way it is.  Final Grade: 3.38, a B-. Banks's Bitter is a decent session ale, but it's still completely forgettable. Is there anything inappropriate for the style, or overtly bad about this bitter? Not really, no. But I cannot think of any legitimate reasons to bother with this one, except for maybe 'it happened to be in a sampler pack that I bought'. It's bland, but serviceable - I could drink this all night if the price were right, but there are plenty of other bitters and EPAs I'd likely select first.

3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,"Appearance – It is golden amber and boasts an impressive head but this was lost very quickly. Light lacing in the glass.

Smell – There is little in the smell of this one to excite there are notes of the malts and hops but these are all mild and pedestrian.

Taste – There is also not a massive amount to say about the taste. So what can I say about this one? It has a tiny hint of flora in the glass and the taste has the suggestion of treacle and earth. 

Mouthfeel – Thin in the mouth and light bodied with a slight astringency.

Overall – The above comments do not mean it is not a good Bitter simply that there are other Bitters out there with more depth of flavour. The barley malts and hops are almost undetectable and although mild and more than drinkable I have to say I do not find this one very exciting.",2014-09-15,35658,Banks's Bitter

4.21,4.0,4.25,4.25,4.0,4.25,"The chill hazed but clear golden amber-colored beer pours out into a Duvel glass with a 1 1/4” full fluffy white head that recedes slowly but visibly while leaving lots of foam and scattered lacing around the sides of the glass. Eventually there’s a cap but as the lacing thins a bit the cap persists for quite a while. Sipping creates a few small patches and legs of lacing. Eventual the cap of foam becomes a small ring around the glass and a large thin irregular island of foam. The aromas are filled with toasted malt against a background of citric zest that seems to be mostly either orange or tangerine. The flavors include some caramel and the zesty citrus flavors expected from the nose. The balance between sweetness and the citric bitterness changes as the beer warms. Initially the gentle bitterness is more up front and more noticeable than the malt backbone and its sweetness, but, as the beer warms, the fruity bitterness softens a bit and then recedes a bit allowing the malt background to show a bit more. The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium-bodied and fairly smooth from the gentle, persistent finely bubbled carbonation. The finish begins as most everything begins to slowly fade away leaving the long ending to the slowly fading of citric bitterness that ends up way in the back of the throat where it persists and persists. Overall a nicely brewed bitter which is both enjoyable and drinkable. It would be easy to repeat and at 4.8% the ABV is a bit higher than I’d prefer in a proper “session beer,” but nonetheless it could serve nicely for an evening of slow sipping of a few pints when good friends are gathered for a comfortable evening chat. Is it as well done as the best of those in the UK? Not sure about that but it is tastier than some I've had.

3.44,4.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A 500ml bottle with a BB of Oct 2012. Picked up last year as part of Sainsbury's beer fest - it's been lingering in my fridge for ages. Poured into a Sam Smith's pint glass. A hazy golden-amber hue with good carbonation. Yields a large head of creamy white foam that lasts for a few minutes before settling on the surface. Evidence of bottle-conditioning. Aroma of grainy malt with a dominant note of stewed hops, followed by dry yeast and a hint of caramel. Tastes of light, biscuity malt with a dry finish. Notes of stewed hops, earthy yeast and caramel. Mild bitterness upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth, tingly and dry, with decent body. Rather astringent. Aftertaste of harsh stewed hops and dry yeast. An OK bitter, but nothing special. The stewed hops are a tad harsh, and it could do with more aromatic hops to balance it out. Drinkable, but probably better on cask.",2012-05-15,18651,Golden Seahawk

The same amber/orangey body, clear and bright, old gold colour as the bottle. Again an impressive snow white head which produced some, lacing and head throughout the tasting.  The smell was, like the bottled one, it's weakest part and although there were hop and malt esters they didn't excite or bother the nose at all. The last paragraph is almost the same as my bottle review: really liked the mouthfeel and taste, good blend of ingredients to produce a fine beer. A mixed bag of flavours, some sweet malty molasses, but no honey: the hops came behind the sweet molasses in the taste stakes but not far behind: this is nicely balanced and easy to drink.",2011-11-08,18651,Golden Seahawk

T: Opens tart and hoppy with notes of biscuits, lemon, bitter orange, herbs, minerals, tobacco, and peppery spice. The finish is hoppy with citrus, spice, and tobacco notes. M: Light-bodied, firm, and dry with very active carbonation. My only knock is that this beer seems to have the ability to dry out your mouth in no time. Should be more drinkable than it is. O: This is a pretty nice bitter, and is especially welcome for fans of hoppier English beers.

3.53,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A tasty English Ale that has the flavor and delicacy of an Ordinary Bitter but with the strength of a Best Bitter or English Pale (very pale) Ale. This beer kinda straddles the fence. The appearance of straw or light golden colors give a soft and even glow to the beer. A mild haze tells the tale of dry-hopping or unfiltered character. Good retention and lacing makes the beer intriguing and inviting. Soft aromas of grain, hay-like maltiness with soft bready sweetness. Spicy, earthy, and grassy hops give a lively and vibrant aroma to the ale. Soft esters of apples, under-rippened pears, and lemon acidity adds complexity to the otherwise simple ale. Flavors follow suit with a balance of soft cracker-like malts with light breads (fresh baked). A balance of spicy, grassy, and sprucy hops offset the sweetess and breadiness and adding a minty, lemony note that adds zest and life. Otherwise a simple estery-apple character decorates the mid palate while the beer fades into a hay-like grassy taste that becomes more refreshing than bitey. Medium up front (somehow I wanted a crisper and cleaner start) but the beer eventually fades into that minty dry, grassy, lemony finish with a steady and pleasant hop bitterness in the finish. I interpret this beer as an Ordinary Bitter (think properly carbonated Boddington's Pub Ale) but with a firmer body and maltier texture.",2010-08-31,18651,Golden Seahawk

4.08,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,5.0,"3rd bottle of the Birds of Prey series sent to me by TATTORSO. Thanks Jeff! This one is in a clear bottle, best by 1 Jan 2011. It pours a clear gold colour, close to a 2 finger head of foam.  The smell is very light, the lightest of the 3. What is there is a nice balance of malt and hops. Sorry I can't expound on that but my nose isn't picking up a whole lot here. The taste saves the day. Up front, some nice malty notes that brings a good amount of sweetness. On the back end, the hops bring a goodly amount of grassy bitterness. In the finish, the sweet takes on a very honey like character with a touch of biscuit/earthy flavours. 3 English Bitters and 3 different angles at the style and all of them work for me.  Curious to say the least. Medium bodied with lightish carbonation. Drinkability? Another Bitter from Cotleigh that I could sit down with and have, very easily, more than 1 or 2 or even 3 of.

It pours a clear, dark orange-golden hue, with a sparse beerhead of big bubbles... minimum carbonation is detected. The nose is a bit too reserved... a tinge of citrusy note and a refreshingly soft, floral aroma of hops is there. Apart from that there really is nothing to write home about. It tastes profoundly hoppy following the initially thin, juicy palate--strong scent of floral hops and a very intensive, herbal kind of flavour are left on the sides of my tongue, balanced by a grapefruit-zesty bitterness and some soft palate of nutty malts at the back of my throat. Jolly nice it is, compared with the timid aroma. On balance it's a Goldings-dominated summer golden ale--actually the understated but consistent flavour of Goldings is the major attraction of this beer, making the mouthfeel refreshingly as well as softly hoppy, helped by moderately dryish mouthfeel which arouses more thirst.

3.42,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,"I've been going to the Granite for several years now, but have always overlooked the regular bitter in preference for some of the other beers on tap. Last night I had a pint with my dinner so I could compare it to the Best Bitter Special, which is one of the best bitters I've ever found. Pours a hazy amber with a finger of white head that quickly dropped to a film, leaving a few spots of lace on the way. Certainly not a great appearance, but not displeasing to the eye. The nose places emphasis on the hopping, with floral and citrus notes complimenting resin. While its certainly hoppy, its not in the league of an IPA, and seems more defined by a lack of malt. The floral and citrus hops come through again in the flavour, though this time there's some light biscuit malt in the background. I find it strange how the malt is downplayed in comparison to the Best Bitter Special, which is essentially the same recipe, but dry hopped. I think that perhaps a feature of the Granite's cask conditioning of the special is that it helps punch up the malt base and create a fine balance. The body is slightly lighter than average for a bitter, but again suffers in comparison to its cask conditioned brother, which exposes a lack of complexity and depth. I can see why this is called Best Bitter, whereas the dry hopped is Best Bitter Special. This beer doesn't have the balance or depth of the Special and won't be a repeat order for me when the Granite do so many other tasty brews.",2009-11-27,2530,Best Bitter

No discernible carbonation. Therefore no head. Colour is orange/copper. Smell is mildly pine/resin but not offensive. Taste is medium pine/citrus hop, giving way to a roasty malt and then mild honey flavours. Mouthfeel is thinnish, but that is mostly because of the lack of any carbonation. Drinkability is ok. Seems to be missing something but I can't put my finger on it. Could be again the lack of carbonation that is throwing me off. I'd love to try this on tap at the brewery. Not as good as I had heard.

Taste is a strong mouth full of hops kicking with floral flavor. All out vegetal and spritely, almost salty in its strength. The malt is highly pale and completely a backdrop to the English hops barrage of potpourri. Drying, snappy, and just about chewy. Mouthfeel is surprisingly medium and rounded nicely, supporting the hops just enough and pulling the malt along to help in the very long, very drying finish. If someone ever asked me, ""What do you mean that hops taste and smell floral?,"" I'd point directly to this beer. Not a bad thing at all, quite tasty but a bit much to my tastes.

It's a fizzy little bugger, but apart from that, mouthfeel is good and flavour lingers - even as you walk down to the Rocks. So - all in all a reasonable beer. HOWEVER marked down due to servng temperature. Simply served far too cold on a winter's night. My bad for having a half. A slow pint would be a much much better bet.",2011-06-05,8253,Victory Bitter

Poured a nice copper-amber colour, solid head and good retention for a bitter. Looked pretty good. Nose was malt, caramel, herbal hops, a bit of citrus. Goldings if I'm not mistaken. A refreshing and tasty bitter (which is saying a lot for me because I'm rarely impressed with them). The hops provide a generous amount of flavor to the brew, which took the form of herbal tea, earth and a bit of citrus. Lovely caramel backing to it.  My only complaint was that the brew felt a bit over-carbonated. Other than that, usual bitter feel. My favorite of the night, the Bitter was certainly a Victory in all senses of the word. A quality pale ale with some flavor, but with a low enough ABV and mild body to mean for some serious consumption. Great work.",2011-05-08,8253,Victory Bitter

Does it make good beer that is what is really important...right??? Well let me tell you....the Victory Bitter is pretty darn good. You can smell the caramel and hops.

Appearance: As served the beer is a clear copper color with a ¼"" white head that persists and leaves some reasonable lacing Smell: The soft light aromas include some touches of caramel laced with lightly herbal hop notes.  Taste: As expected from the nose the flavors include some lightly sweet caramel interwoven with the herbal and lightly bitter character of the hops. Some well balanced flavors here. Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is medium to light bodied and smooth with adequate carbonation. The finish is medium length and begins with the sweet malt that fades away. The finish then ends with some herbal and lightly dry hop bitterness Drinkability: I enjoyed sipping my way through this one and would say fresh on tap at the brewpub this is the best of the three Lord Nelson beers I sampled while in Sydney.

The amber ale is marketed as a traditional English bitter but it's not as traditional as you might think - it is served at the standard British temperature but it tastes a lot like a traditional American amber without much British ale characteristic.

Description (from menu): ""The flagship ale of Dockyard Brewing this copper coloured ale is a traditional English Bitter. Created using the finest Noble hops this brew is all round crowd pleaser to be enjoyed with all foods!"". ABV not listed. A: Clear amber/copper orange. A dollop of creamy off-white head and a fair amount of rising carbonation. S: Unassuming mild aroma of mildly toasted cereal grain, a hint of sweet fruit covered and light covering of spicy hopping. T: A balanced and fairly rich union of caramel maltiness and lightly spicy/dry hops. Bittering grows to a point then fades to subtle fruit and soft toffee sweetness, then evolves again to a lengthy bitter conclusion. M: Light body, modest carbonation. Crisp, clean finish and lingering bittering. D: A favorite from the first sip.

T- The deep toasted note with some brown malt wort has a watery flavor to follow with a soft green woody hop note in the finish. The finish is a bit dry.  M- The medium mouthfeel is followed by a very soft prick of carbonation and a touch of astringency with a grain husk quality.

A bright clarity revealed a silent carbonation (a trend im starting to sense in all their beers). In the meantime the head collapsed void of any lacing. Being my third beer from this brewery in as many days all their beers seem to appear the similar. S: Again a scent and strength hardly worth mentioning. Soft grated orange peels and nothing much else to offer here. The total lack of effort warrants a less then average rating here. T: The flavor faired better but not by much. Sharp citric tones with a flowery hopping of light proportions opens things up. Dry grains lurk beneath with hints of dried grapefruit peel and dried oranges. As with the nose and their other beers (Marsh mellow, &amp; Pride of Oxford) the flavor is rather boring and bland and simply forgettable, perhaps the only favorable trait that I agree with.  M: The mouthful did display a small touch of carbonation tingle despite the calm demeanor of effervesce. Light bodied but comes off a bit washy at times and rather boring to behold.  D: An easy enough drink to consume which makes this a mindless downer.

The body is rather thin, with a touch of water, though it is smooth and holds up well-enough to fit the modest abv. An easy-drinking ""session"" ale. Well-hopped, though balanced.

The flavor and aroma are balanced featuring a bright, clean malt sweetness and body (golden promise or similar?). There is a light whisp of hop crispness to hold it together. It is smooth, rich, drinkable, barely not-thin but definitely not thin (if that makes a lick of sense), with a little sparkle of bubbles at the end. Very, very nice. Exactly what it should be and nothing it shouldn't. Complex but simple malt character. Lovely and although it might just be me freaking out over my first proper pint in a real pub drinking real ale and that that might just make it different and novel, it was great despite any of that.

3.72,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,"500ml bottle, thanks again to Rob and Karen from Noseworthy Imports, and Jim from Sherbrooke liquor for the sneak peek freebie. This beer pours a frosted glass, medium golden colour, with a teeming tower of thinly puffy off-white head, which leaves some broad and varied arches of lace around the glass as it consistently recedes. It smells of crisp, slightly toasted, and biscuity grain, light citrus fruit pith, a bit of baker's yeast, and earthy, tangy, and leafy hop bitters. The taste is somewhat sour, bready malt, a bit of aged lemon fruitiness, and evenly oriented, bitter citrusy and leafy noble hops. The carbonation is a bit frothy in its bearing, the body a sturdy middleweight, and smooth, but with a slight zesty addendum. It finishes off-dry, the fruity malt and reserved bitterness doing well in their lingering tandem jig. Overall, a decent Old World bitter, to be sure, with an extra fruity oomph, to placate those without tolerance for the extra-dry, I suppose. Anyways, a welcome addition to the Alberta beer-scape, even if that's to be a wee bit down the road from now.",2012-06-21,27557,Edinburgh Gold

The lace holds and the bead is fine. The smell is fragrant with some light floral notes with mild citrus and subtle caramel sweetness in the nose. The feel is decent for a cask bitter-well balanced overall, however the yeast seems to dominate the hops slightly. The sweetness level is good as is the mild body and alcohol.  This bitter is flavored with enough fruity yeast and mild toasted flavors in the malt for my taste. I just prefer the hops to show a little more bitterness to balance. The hops do show up in the flavor more as floral/fruity than bitter and seem somewhat juicy when combined with the gentle sweetness of the malt and English yeast.

T - Good amount of earthy hops up front slowly giving way to a mix of lightly toasted cereal malt and some lingering hop bitterness. The finish is just like the taste, with some lingering hop bitterness. This was good but I think it could have used a bit more citric hops. The earthy hops were good but they were a bit one dimensional. Still pretty good. M - Light body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Smooth, creamy, feel throughout.

Incredibly dense and smooth yet ethereal and light all at once due to the smaller bubbles.  Very unique aroma - a light carmel malt backbone plays against many herbal notes: mint, lemon verbena, cherry, hungarian peppers, etc. A touch of DMS or skunkiness perhaps. Something seems amiss. Slightly sour, herbal, and almost savory - but decidedly though not aggressively bitter. Finish is a bit toasty, peppery, and earthy with a lingering taste of sulfur and a touch of ammonia. The nitro-tap is supposed to increase the surface area that is in contact with your tongue, bringing out more flavor while yielding a sensation of added body to what is otherwise a pretty light beer.

I had enjoyed that bottle, but wasn't rushing out to pick up more. That all changed this Friday as every beer sampled was delicious. I think, as with a lot of small breweries, freshness is key here. Anyway, I picked up a couple of 22oz. bombers, my favorite of which was the Hope Street Bitter: A: Pours a reddish amber with virtually no head. The color is warm and very attractive, but the lack of head greatly reduces the beauty of the pour. S: Floral hop bitterness prevails over the slightest hint of booze. The smell is a bit subdued, but fresh and inviting. T: Very smooth and excellently balanced, the fresh, floral hop taste prevails as it does in the aroma. It's beautiful balanced over a smooth malt background, and is again tinged with the just the slightest hint of hot booze, which in this case is rather pleasant. This is among the best versions of the style I've had, and the beauty of the fresh, floral hop flavor is allowed to shine without dominating the other flavors. There's a lot of subtlety to be enjoyed here. M: Good, medium bodied feeling; very low carbonation as evidenced in the pour, all accompanied by a slight, pleasant boozy heat. I'd really love to try this on cask, as it seems perfectly suited to the serving style.

It pours with just a few pockets of bubbles on the top, no friggen head at all. No carbonation it looks like. The beer is a semi clear slight hazy dark amber copper brown color.  The nose has some light sweetness, a little brown sugar it seems, light fruits like a slight fig, some light aged hops aromas, bitter U.K. style hops, not much for hop aroma overall, but it has that typical English bitter like hop aroma.  The taste is somewhat light too. The severe lack of carbonation makes a huge dent in it too. It has a nice bitterness though, a typical English bitter like bitterness, some aged hops. Not much for a hop flavor, but a bit of earthy and deep fruit hops. A very slight mild grassy flavor. Some sweetness, and a hint of brown sugar, and little crystal malt. It finishes with a long bitterness, not super bitter but it just lasts. A slight earthy and grassy flavor, and a very slight flavor of that bitterness I'm not a fan of.  The mouth is medium bodied, but no carbonation at all... was Tomme Arthur a guest brewer on this one or something? The drinkability is OK, some lingering bitterness, but no real hammering off flavors or anything that makes you go bleh.

Two complaints: I had this in a bottle. I'm guessing that it is just perfect when hand pumped from a cask but in a bottle it lacks carbonation and body. If it's being sold in a bottle, shouldn't it be engineered to be just right when poured? Second, I love hops but there was a little more lingering, biting hop aftertaste then I'd expect from the style.  I had to ding it for appearance not only because of the lack of carbonation but because it's very hazy stuff.

3.56,4.0,3.5,3.75,3.25,3.25,"500ml bottle. Named kind of perfunctorily after a local (to the brewer) railway switching station, apparently. Given my current situation, I'm more reminded of that bygone lurid website, Consumption Junction. Sigh. This beer pours a clear medium bronzed amber hue, with two fingers of foamy, bubbly pale tan head, which leaves some nicely scraggly webbed lace around the glass as it readily sinks away. It smells of musty caramel malt, aged apple and pear fruitiness, and slightly spicy, leafy, herbal hops. The taste is semi-sweet caramel malt, a touch of sour biscuity breadiness, a bit of musky jam and toast, and perky, still zingy leafy, earthy hops. The carbonation is pretty much on the low-fi side, but not totally inert, as I can still feel the inherent support provided, the body a sturdy medium weight, and generally smooth, a bit of cloying pithiness in play. It finishes on the sweet side, the restrained caramel malt contending more with its own deficiencies than any contention from the lingering fruity, spicy, and herbal hop notes. Not the most prototypical of English Bitters, but enjoyable enough in its own right - if you are a disciple of the malty side, that is, fruitiness included.

The mouthfeel and drinkability is of course the predominant selling point of this beer. Even a 20 oz pint is amazingly sessionable and goes down quite easily.

Very English colour, good elsewhere as well. Nose is actually quite lagery in a sense, just very bitter with little malt character. I think it's just that there's a slightly German hop character to it, bitter and slightly spicy, with a hint of pepper and green tea on there. Slight caramelly malt lingers at the back, smells good, yeah smells bitter. Taste is again very bitter. Slight hint of biscuity malt at the front but otherwise a mostly tasteless, watery introduction. Hops come on gradually but with crescendo force to create a herbal and phenolic, slightly spicy bitterness towards the finish, hint of vanilla on there and some woody character, maybe some eucalyptus as well. Slight breadiness on the very back is a disappointment, because it feels like an accident, just happening to emerge from the murkiness of the pleasant hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is slick, with a sharpness around the bitter finish probably not to everyone's taste but I quite enjoy it. Quite thin but with a fair punch to it. At 3.8% I would hardly expect a syrupy brew. My first taste of any Burtonised brew - or at least, a Burtonised brew that makes a big deal about being Burtonised, and I have to say pretty decent.

Hops and herbal bitterness with a fairly generous helping of citrus zest. Sweet malt in the finish with an unfortunate touch of butter.  Drinkable bitter, though a bit on the slippery side for me.

4.1,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,"Purchased at the Sainsbury's supermarket. Coming in a slim 500ml brown bottle, BB Nov. 09, served cool in a straight imperial pint glass. A: pours a clear golden hue, decorated with constant streams of mild fizziness and a thick, well-lasting light beige froth.  S: elderflower, lychee fruits, annise-seed, oranges and grapefruits all spring to mind, on top of a focused but moderately aromatic sweet maltiness with a tinge of stinky oat biscuits. Nice, very hoppy and deliciously fruity. T: delicious &amp; aromatic flowery hoppiness, light citric zestiness, an exotic taste of lychee-skins, along with a dryish-sweet touch of annise-seeds prevail on the palate... Gradually, the understated herbal bitter-sweetness and tangy grapefruit-iness take over, leaving a really chewy aftertaste with a wee bit of malty undernote lurking underneath. M&amp;D: refreshing on the palate thanks to microscopic fizz, while the zesty and flowery hoppiness also serve to elevate the whole drinking experience. I feel that malts are quite negligible in the flavour profile, or, should I say that, they are blended in too well, offering a solid platform for the flowery &amp; citric elements to dance freely?

This had been open two days when I tried it, but it was still fresh and fizzy. I would rate this as a nearly perfect bitter. The only minor detraction is for the appearance. The color was just right, a deep gold with copper highlights, and the small but persistent head was style-appropriate too, but there was some cloudiness. This doesn't really bother me, except that I've had cask-conditioned bitters in England that came out crystal clear. Smooth sailing from there... The nose was grainy, with some fruity esters and hints of caramel, plus just the right hoppiness (not overhopped for the style, like many American versions, IMO). The flavor was predominantly malty, with some caramel sweetness and fruitiness, but balanced well by hop bitterness. (I'm guessing they use British hops, which is nearly essential for this style.)  The mouthfeel almost gets a detraction - when I drank this it was perfect for a bitter, not too fizzy, not quite flat, which makes me think that it must have been overcarbonated when tapped three days ago. But since it was good when I had it, I give it a great score. Overall, a fantastic session beer, and a bitter that would fit in nicely in an English pub.",2006-03-01,4093,Bitter

Basically, a very good recreation of a subtly-balanced traditional English cask bitter, designed for easy quaffing by the pint.

The head puffs up aggressively with each pour, which made filling the glass into a bit of a chore. Tons of lacing and good retention. The aroma is pretty much all Sorachi Ace, a difficult to describe mix of herbal and citrus notes. There's lemongrass, lemon verbena, lemons, grass, peppercorn and earth, but it's heaviest on the herbs and not terribly juicy, as far as citrus-y hops go. There's some fresh barley in the background. The taste is dry and bitter. The bitterness doesn't knock you over the head, but it's firm and somewhat sharp, as such beers are wont to be - and by that, I mean low abv beers that are dry and hoppy. Very good hop flavor on the tongue. You really get a nice blast of Sorachi Ace's lemony herbal notes. There's also a pleasant background of fresh malt sweetness, though, again, the beer is pretty dry. Mouthfeel starts out quite lively, but once the head dies down enough to drink the beer comfortably, the beer has a certain smoothness. It's fuller than expected. This beer packs a ton of flavor into 2.5% abv. Great showcase for Sorachi Ace, probably the best that I've come across. I would love to have this on local store shelves, and considering it survived some time traveling around Europe and a flight back to San Francisco, I would encourage the brewery to consider distribution here. It's particularly interesting to see some excellent, non Biere de Garde/Saison work come out of France. I would love to try more from this brewery.

Head fades fairly quickly, leaves some lacing, but the carbonation is fairly low, par for the course on cask. Aroma of quite strong and sweet caramel right off the bat, almost candyish. Thankfully the taste doesn't quite follow suit. Certainly there's a definite toffee note, but there's a good hop balance, with noble English varieties noticeable. Herbal notes and a dry finish. Mouthfeel is well defined and full without being too much for the style, and drinkability is excellent. I'm quite a fan, it's right on the money for the traditional bitter style.

Slightly musty malt character, fresh english hops and some caramel sweetness Taste, crisp bittering hops, caramel tinged bready malt, dry hops on the finish leaving a hoppy reminder on the palette along with some grassiness A very drinkable bitter. 3.7% but full of hops and bready malt flavour.

Deep copper color turning brown along the middle. A slight creamy head sits atop for a minute. Aroma has this sweet caramel graininess along with some zesty floral, lemony hops. A bit of toffee and yeastyness too. Taste is simpler but quite enjoyable. Light fruits dominate, pears and peaches and golden delicious apples. A bit of hoppy spicyness is in there but its restrained. The yeasty drying effect really kicks in towards the back. I was surprised by how easily these went down without myself getting too bored or losing interest. Obviously its not a punch in the face and not the most complex, but its damn smooth and quite intriguing. A great session beer.",2006-03-14,5687,TSB

S: lightly sweet caramel along with raisin-like fruity nose and some faint trace of hops--not complex at all. T: soft, refreshing and lightly fruity taste of hops and soft grainy pale malts, followed by good lingering, dryish bitterness at the back of the throat, with mild trace of light chocolatey malts(?). Quite interestingly, the vertical, dryish bitter mouthfeel lingers better than the overall flavour (does it make sense to anyone?).

Aroma is mild sweet malt with a light cola like spicy sourness. Flavor is light malt, sour with wild yeast notes. Light bodied with less carbonation than I'd expect from the massive head. There seem to be multiple reports of infected bottles, but I don't know if this wild yeast sourness is intended or if this is another infected bottle.

3.21,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,"Orange brown color, tanned cap looks really nice. Tons of lace that really coats the glass, while the cap sticks for the duration.  Nose is unfortunately both really weak and buried by that head. Mostly dark fruit notes, with a big sour component. Also unfortunate is the abject lack of hops reported by my olfactory sense.  Just a little boring; an English mild that gives no indication of stepping up in the world. Some dark fruit, only hints of bitterness, and a little bit of apple skin make up the flavor.  Working together to pull down the score however is a combination of sourness, high carbonation, and a bone dry finish. These really suck the life out of a brew with not much life to give.  Not a very tasty beer. Hmm. I just noticed that it's supposed to be a bitter. That's very confusing - I feel like I'm going to disregard that because it's much closer to a mild in terms of malt-hops balance. Weird.",2009-06-18,25415,Waterloo Bottle Conditioned Ale

The beer itself is murky brown with a ridiculously huge head with excellent retention. Lots of pretty lace is smattered about the glass. S - Buttered toast and marmalade. This smells really English...I mean you could probably define the term ""English ale"" with this nose. It's malty, toasty, and dirty...not malty, toasty, and clean like an O-Fest. I think English hops are really floral and less pine and citrus oriented than American ales. I prefer the hoppy brews from our great nation, and this isn't all that awesome to be honest. T - Uh, diacetyls all up in my face. This tastes like rancid butter on stale toast. Not good, not good. M - Lighter side of medium with an acrid finish.  D - Not good, not good.

2.26,3.5,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,"Rusted orange peel with a chaotic amount of carbonation. The sandstone colored crown had no choice but to fill the entire glass on the initial pour. The shrinking head is styrofoam stiff, rocky and unsticky. Surprisingly, more lace ends up adhering than I'd have guessed. The nose is both pathetically low on power and too sour for the style. If this is an English bitter, then why don't I smell the hops? For that matter, why did the brewery use American hops? (variety not named). Is is possible that Waterloo tastes drastically different than it smells? Let's just say that I'm skeptical. I don't know what this beer is supposed to be, but an English bitter it ain't. At least not a good one. There is an underlying bitterness present, but it's hopelessly buried beneath a puckery sourness that paints the flavor profile with the ugly brush. Think unripe peaches, little green apples and lemons.  The flimsy, minimally caramel-like backbone doesn't stand a chance against twin tidal waves of sour and bitter. I can sorta taste what Freeminer was attempting to do. On second thought, that's probably giving both them and me too much credit. This just isn't good beer. Why Rogue is importing it is anyone's guess. The mouthfeel, amazingly enough, isn't overly bubbled. It looks like the carbonation has a fairly short half-life. With more heft, I might have been tempted to nudge the score up to average. More malt guys. How hard is that? I've seen both Waterloo and Trafalger IPA, here and there, for the past year or so, but held off buying them due to the ridiculous price tag. In a regrettable moment of weakness last month, I plunked down $5.79 for this bottle. Big mistake.

3.83,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,"This is beer is a bit of surprise given the low ABV. At 4.5, it has more taste and mouth feel than I imagined. It pours a cloudy copper, with a little bit of orange tinge. Although the bottle does mention live yeast, you won't find any swimming around, so there is some filtration. Having said that, it is naturally carbonated, and the carbonation stays around for awhile. You'll get at least a one inch, if not more, head. It doesn't lace as much as the puffy parts of the head stick to the side of the glass as you go down. The smell is good, not brilliant, but what you would come to expect from a British style ale. The taste is good, lots of different malts going on in here, and there is a hoppy after bite. I can't pin down the taste to anything in particular. It's a little on the dry side, an ever so hint of sweetness, but not overly sweet, the hops are only noticeable on the end, not so much in the nose. I don't think you can go wrong with this one.

Even when i refilled my glass the original head rose back to the top like whipping cream.Vigorous carbonation also helpsl head retention. The aroma reminds me of Cascade hops with a touch of a mineral water scent. Sharp piney, earthy bitterness begins the flavor which segues into a distinct high lovibond carmel malt flavor that always reminds me of grapenuts cereal. The bitterness fades and the malt flavors being of a more toasty flavor also fade and this beer finishes very clean.  The carbonation is a bit prickly and it emphasizes the hops a bit more than I would expect from an english bitter.

It even has a mulled cider-like taste to it, which carries over into the mouthfeel on fine champaigny effervescence. Flavors of cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg lasts throughout. The hops have a peppery spiciness with a taste of watery lemonade sneaking in behind.  As it warms the fine bubbles are more subdued.

The finish is rather sweet and mellow. Intrigueing mouthfeel..keeps you coming back to see what else is going to happen.

Seems simple, but it's more interesting than what I'm describing. The feel is somewhat flat and warm, but naturally dry.

There's a very slight and subtle buttery character. It's kinda distracting, but it also does kind of add a nice smoothness to the beer. This is fairly hoppy, and quite bitter, with floral hops galore. There's some slight fruit flavor, and a firm malt backbone, bready but not sweet.

4.23,4.0,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"(from notes) Tried this on cask at J. Ryan's- omit the apostrophe here on the archive.  Look- Arrived at the table looking like rosy maple syrup without any visible carbonation and a finger or so of tight white foam that settled to a thin film fairly quickly. Left the inside of the glass completely coated with a dense lather that fell into streakier legs as the pint emptied.  Smell- Pretty faint, especially considering the temperature it was served at. I got a hint of orange peel and light flowery and oaky notes. Agitation didn't produce any discernable changes. Taste- Woody and the tiniest bit sweet, with pine and apricot undertones. Finished with a light biscuit/toffee. Aftertaste wass mild and flowery. Quite good. Mouthfeel- Starts crisp without being sharp, light to medium body and lightly carbonated. Warming and smooth through the finish, with some dryness afterward. Spot-on for the style. Overall- Just the right balance of refreshing and fortifying, this beer is outstandingly understated. It might be just me, but it also seemed profoundly ""English"", much more so than the few other American- made real ale bitters I've tried. The brewers also did a masterful job of hiding the 6.5% ABV, it drinks like the traditional 3-4 and I'd happily put back a few more.

I was surprised to find it was 6.5% as the body was thinner than most beers, even on cask, at that strength. Still, this only seemed to make it more drinkable. The beer itself was a mix of mellow biscuit and cracker grains with a big hit of grapefruit and grassy tangerine hops on.

Good sized light tan head that left a good amount of lacing. The aroma has a nice mix of both malt and hops as it gives off slight flowery and fruit like smell. Also a very slight butter like smell but is well hidden behind the other aromas and mixes well. The flavor is very nice, hop flavor really shines not because it is big but because the flavor that it does give off is extremely nice. While the hop presence is what really makes this beer for me the malt flavors that are present are very good and play the perfect accompaniment. Brew has a nice feel as the hop end lingers and the feel of the beer itself is quite creamy. I must say that I really liked this brew, very easy drinking and what I liked is that it is not trying to be something it is not.

The hops are a little bit flowery and a little bit citrusy. It finishes bitter which brings it back to the style. M: Nice full creamy body. Very creamy in fact.

A few tiny bubbles float up. Looks thirst-quenching. Nice lacing. The first smell is a heavy ringwood yeast. Bitter, flowery hops. A woody, flowery kind of bitter flavor. Definitely NOT an IPA style. Has an extra hint of mild oak toward the end. The taste, again, is heavy yeast. A bitter (like the Middle Ages Beast Bitter) but much more flowery than usual. Hops are bitter but also flowery/grassy. Hint of perfume in the flavor. As it warms, the hops turn to a bitter grapefruit. Definitely more bitter toward the end. Feels thick and ashy. Full-bodied and creamy. Leaves a film.

Smells are mostly malt with the yeast working up a fruity aroma. Tastes are the same in this well-integrated brew in which the hops come through to prevent sweetness. Even for its style, I found it a bit thin... but nice bubbles to clear the palate. I went on Wynchwood's website and it is different... or has character as they like to say about themselves. The graphics make me feel like I am in the gnome's home. But, it is very creative; lots of games to play and the English sense of humor is in full flow. They seem to do a good business, although are open only 4 days a week... so I suspect it is mostly weekenders. But I do wonder how a small brewer in a small town in the Cotswolds makes it to the Midwest and frequently is on the shelves.

Mild earthy hoppyness in the scent which I really like. The taste is a bit thinner than the nose which was disappointing. Mouthfeel fine with decent carbonation.

Colour is a semitransparent gold.  Sm: Cream, bland hops, and light malt. A very light aroma all around.  T: Marvelous cream opens to a simple full barley body with cream notes throughout. A good effective bitter, but a bit bland. It's refreshing, and built well for its aims. Nicely balanced, but then it's just one note. No alcohol comes through. Resembles a cream ale in a curious way.  Mf: Smooth, wet, and incredibly light. I don't know how they keep it this fragile without making it watery. Complements the creamy taste very well.

3.43,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,"I had this beer on tap in a small pub in the western part of England. Served on cask, the beer had a golden-amber hue with a small creamy head. The aroma was faint, but presented a little pale malt and distant hops. The taste is the most interesting aspect of the beer. It has a pronounced acidity that creates a certain crispness, but also distracts from the underlying malt and hop flavors. The malt comes across next, with a constant undercurrent of flavor without sweetness. Hops are present, but remain firmly in the far background, except for a touch of bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with a moderate lightness in heft. It's a reasonably good session beer, and the acidity both adds and subtracts (it's a little overdone) from its attractiveness.

Name says it all; at least for the color ... it retains a good ring of lace for the duration of the pint. Caramel, ripe apples, dried grass and a walnut yeast tone make for a well-rounded aroma. Deep smoothness as the carbonation digs into any residuals; very malty with cara- mel, toasted bread and animal feed grain. A bigger body than expected. Hint of mineral and buttery flavor. A tad yeasty and a faint apple cider twang lead to a hard-pulling dry- ness in the end.

Very light grassy/floral hops that contribute a punch of tea-like bitterness on the end. This one is balanced to the bitter side but doesn't necessarily have much in the way of hop flavor. Clean fermentation profile with only a hint of fruit. Light-bodied but not watery in the least, if that makes sense. A nice little Bitter. I'm trying hard not to let my giddiness at finding a true session Bitter in Oklahoma (and a fairly fresh one at that) inflate my review at all.

Froathy off-white head with good formation, retention, and lacing. This beer is meant for a cask. Fruity aromas, biscuity-sweet malts, and earthy/grassy hop notes fill the nose in very English-like fashion. It's the quentessential English aroma profile. The prototype English character carries over seamlessly in flavor as well. Sweet, fruity, and rooted in classic Marris Otter sturdy maltiness. Earthy, pungent, spicy, and floral hops give a lot of flavor along with bitterness in the finish. Beautiful enough, the medium flavors translate to a lighter body than expected.

Woody with a hint of tobacco at first, becoming fruity and vaguely floral later on, with hints of oxidation already. Something musty and odd is there, but it's hard to put a finger on. Joe says ""old man cologne"" which isn't that far off.  Dry with a mild note of bready malt sweetness. Faded, muddled fruit. Dull and papery, signaling the onset of oxidation.

The smell is nice and malty with good biscuit notes and some fruity citrus tones. Simple but a very inviting nose. The taste follows the nose. Big biscuit malt up front with light bitterness of a citrus fruity type...I'd say lemon would be what I'm tasting and it dominates the finish and leaves a nice aftertaste. The bitterness somewhat intensifies as the session goes on... On the high end of light bodied with a similar level of carbonation, it has a good mouthfeel. Btw, the foam and lacing gave up about mid session but noot too big of a deal. Drinkability? A true Session beer is what we have here and I'm sure I could drink this back to back to back....very damn quaffable! The only knock from me is that it's just a tad more bitter than I expected.
