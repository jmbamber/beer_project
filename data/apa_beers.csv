These, the words of the Conjurer-in-Chief; Wallace Stevens, describe in perfect detail the work of a brewer as he sits to write a new recipe. Perfection is the goal, to fill a desire for a perfect beer. Yet the instrument of his mind and that of the brewhouse and yeast are the fallible tools at hand. And so he patches it as he can. A little hop here, a little citrus there, a yeast to marry the two, the worty substrate of reality calling the key and time signature. The beer that comes will be the beer we drink, the beer whose story we will tell here. The brewer does what he can and imagines a world quite round.
