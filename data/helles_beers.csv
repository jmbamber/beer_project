29145,Aecht Schlenkerla Helles Lagerbier,Brauerei Heller-Trum / Schlenkerla,German Helles,4.3%,89,3.98,434,799,“Schlenkerla Helles” is brewed with fine Bavarian aroma hops from the area around the city of Nürnberg. It's lagered in century old caves underneath the historic Schlenkerla brewery and maltings. Schlenkerla Helles is boiled in the same copper kettles and bottom fermented by the same yeast as the historic Schlenkerla Smokebeer. Its subtle smokiness without using smoke malt makes “Helles Schlenkerla Lager” a unique representative of the classic lager beer style “Bavarian Helles”.

The malts we use impart a wonderful, fresh grain character, reminiscent of European lagers. The German Noble hop, Mittelfrüh, lends a mild lemony, spicy flavor. The German word “Helles” translates as “light” and “Lager” means “to store”. This beer style emerged in Germany through the Spaten Brewery’s marriage of British, Bohemian and German brewing techniques. This style is an integral part of brewing history and a predecessor of the straw-colored, light-bodied beers which are the most widely consumed beers in the world today. The lager yeast ferments the beer more slowly and at lower temperatures; it is then stored for maturation. This results in a beer which is more smooth and drinkable. Today, many American craft brewers offer this style as a maltier and hoppier alternative to American light lagers. 17 IBU"

Now it's back, new and improved, for those who finally want a better lager. In a craft world dominated by hoppy beers, we have gone back to basics with Firestone Lager. this is our hardest beer to make--and our easiest one to drink. Made in the classic all-malt Munich Helles style, Firestone Lager demands technical perfection from our brewing team, with a transparent canvas that would otherwise reveal the smallest flaw. Gambrinus pilsner malt establishes a crisp, dry base with a soft mouthfeel, while noble German hops provide just a whisper of bitterness. The result is an impossibly smooth and immensely drinkable beer that aims to help redefine American Lager.  In the words of Brewmaster Matt Brynildson, ""Firestone Lager is made for drinking, not thinking. It's all about enjoying a good, clean beer."""

After three months of conditioning, we moved the beer to stainless steel and krausened with fresh-fermenting Mary to provide natural carbonation.  Following more than a month of slow, gentle carbonation, we now proudly pour for you an elevated expression of Marie, one that demonstrates our progressive pursuit for refinement while honoring and ennobling the most inspiring elements of classical brewing tradition.
