222,Fuller's London Pride,Fuller Smith & Turner PLC,English Bitter,4.1%,88,3.94,"1,114","2,681"," just the iconic ale of the capital, London Pride is an all-British affair that unites a nation of beer drinkers. It’s brewed with entirely home-grown hop varieties - Target for bittering and Northdown, Challenger and Goldings for aroma - but the soul of the beer is unquestionably in the malt.  Crystal malts combine with spring-harvested Pale Ale varieties Concerto and Propino, to give Pride its inimitable depth and balance. Brewed to 4.1%, this tawny-coloured premium ale borrows sweet raisin, biscuit and dried-fruit notes from the Crystal malt, while fresh, piney herbs emanate from the hops. Rich, smooth and elegant on the palate, it draws to a clean, satisfying finish with beautifully balanced bitterness."
828,Bluebird Bitter,Coniston Brewing Co. Ltd,English Bitter,4.2%,87,3.88,305,495,"Bluebird is a fine session ale with a light golden colour. The intense resinous and spicy hop character which is the beer's hallmark is derived from the use of unusual quantities of English Challenger hops, each bale being individually and personally selected by the brewer. The malt is, of course, Maris Otter fermented slightly warm to give a soft fruitiness with a faint hint of scented geranium."
